CRITICAL: Previous deployments failed - code changes not applied
This file forces Docker cache invalidation and ensures new code is deployed.
Memory optimization fixes and Render bypass mode must be deployed.

DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:
1. Look for "[DEPLOYMENT] NEW CODE ACTIVE" in logs
2. Look for "[STARTUP] Starting heavy imports at startup"  
3. Look for "[REFRESH] Render mode detected" during /refresh
4. NO MORE memory crashes during /refresh

If this deployment still shows old behavior, there is a fundamental 
Render configuration or webhook issue that needs manual intervention.

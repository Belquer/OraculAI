Appendix 1, Lessons for the Scholars
The following stories and parables, most borrowed from western traditions,
all have something to teach the modern student and Yixue scholar. The modern
academic traditions and fads are no more immune to the problems and fallacies
described here than were the Han Dynasty Yiweishu trends.
The Blind Men and the Elephant
by John Godfrey Saxe (1816-1887)
It was six men of Indostan, to learning much inclined,
Who went to see the elephant (though all of them were blind)
That each by observation might satisfy his mind.
The First approached the elephant, and happening to fall
Against his broad and sturdy side, at once began to bawl:
"God bless me! but the elephant is nothing but a wall!"
The second, feeling of the tusk, cried "Ho! what have we here
So very round and smooth and sharp? To me 'tis mighty clear:
This wonder of an elephant is very like a spear!"
The Third approached the animal, and, happening to take
The squirming trunk within his hands, thus boldly up and spake:
"I see," quoth he, "the elephant is very like a snake!"
The Fourth reached out his eager hand and felt about the knee:
"What most this wondrous beast is like is mighty plain," quoth he;
"'Tis clear enough the elephant is very like a tree!"
The Fifth, who chanced to touch the ear, said "E'en the blindest man
Can tell what this resembles most, deny the fact who can,
This marvel of an elephant is very like a fan!"
The Sixth no sooner had begun about the beast to grope
Than, seizing on the swinging tail that fell within his scope,
"I see," quoth he, "the elephant is very like a rope!"
And so these men of Indostan disputed loud and long,
Each in his own opinion exceeding stiff and strong,
Though each of them was partly right, and all were in the wrong!
So, oft in theologic wars the disputants, I ween,
Rail on in utter ignorance of what each other mean,
And prate about an elephant not one of them has seen!

The Emperor’s New Clothes
Hans Christian Andersen
(public domain version, translator is uncredited)
Many years ago there was an Emperor who was so excessively fond of
new clothes that he spent all his money in dress. He did not trouble himself in the
least about his soldiers; nor did he care to go eit her to the theatre or the chase,
except for the opportunities then afforded him for displaying his new clothes. He
had a different suit for each hour of the day; and as of any other king or emperor,

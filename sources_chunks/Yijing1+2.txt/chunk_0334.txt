_____The Book of Poetry [Shijing]: Chinese Text with English Translation.
Shanghai: The Chinese Book Co., 1931. I cannot recommend this
translation, nor Ezra Pound's. Both sacrifice too much of the original
images in adapting to English poetic forms. But the Chinese text is here.
_____The Shoo King or The Book of Historical Documents, with minor text
corrections and a Concordance Table.  Hong Kong University Press,
1960, 1970. Chinese Classics series, v3. PL 2461 R43 1970 v.3. Bilingual.
This is the set to have, in spite of difficult organization and archaic
transcription. The series also contains Mengzi and Kongzi's Analects, but it
does not contain the whole of the Li Ji , (only the Great Learning  and the
Doctrine of the Mean ) or the Yi Jing .
_____The She King or The Book of Poetry, with minor text corrections and
Concordance Tables. Hong Kong University Press, 1960, 1970. Chinese
Classics series, v4. PL 2461 R43 1970 v.4. Bilingual. A much more literal
translation than The Book of Poetry  above.
_____The Ch'un Ts'ew, with the Tso Chuen [Chunqiu & Zuozhuan], with
minor text corrections and a Concordance Table.  Hong Kong University
Press, 1960, 1970. Chinese Classics series, v5. PL 2461 R43 1970 v.5.

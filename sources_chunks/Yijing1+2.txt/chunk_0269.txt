The Symbolism: Kan, as water in action, cut ting a river canyon or filling a pit,
symbolizes a fluid response to context, the deliberate changing of self and shape to
meet needs and necessities. From above, the human perspective, there arise feelings
in the pit of the stomach, and a pounding of the heart, when one wishes to cross
this tricky ground, the challenge ahead. The point is, of course, that the teacher is
at work below, patient yet opportunistic. The solution to the problem ahead is not
a single leap in a single direction, but a series of risks, decisions and choices. These
will call upon memory, second-hand if not first, and concentration, meaning to
locate oneself around something central, such as oneâ€™s courage, heart or balance.

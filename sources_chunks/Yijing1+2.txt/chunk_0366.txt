sterner, more urgent advice, rather than simple
predictions of doom. It is claimed frequently in the Wings, especially in the Xiao Xiang, that
propitiousness is due to other Yao De  (Line Character) dimensions, particularly of Dang,
Appropriateness, and Zheng, Correctness, but I doubt seriously that a thorough statistical
analysis would bear this out. This is not to say that these Yao De  dimensions did n

provide frequent and sometimes good excuses for apt comments.
Below are some of the meanings which the Six Line Positions either began with or
acquired in later analysis. The associations are general, and many are not supported by
actual words and references within the Zhouyi text. The effects of multiple dimensions and
extended metaphors make these approximate.

The Yao De or Line Characteristics
The term Yao De refers to a set of interrelationships of individual Lines both to their
Places and to other Lines. All, except for Ruling Lines, are geometrically expressible on the
Xian Tian Ba Gong grid. As with the Yao Wei, there is no explicit reference to the Yao De
set of dimensions in the Zhouyi text. But, unlike Line Positions,

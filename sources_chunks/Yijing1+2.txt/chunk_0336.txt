Yijing Bibliography C List
The following works were also studied within the scope of this research,
but were of little or no help in this translation. This does not mean they have no
value, only that they did not further an understanding of the Chinese text or a
scholarly study of the Yi.
Will Adcock, I Ching: A Practical Guide to Interpretation and Divination
Carol Anthony, Love, An Inner Connection: Based on Principles Drawn from
the I Ching  and The Other Way: A Book of Experiences in Meditation

references. Two more pertinent books are listed in the bibliography above.

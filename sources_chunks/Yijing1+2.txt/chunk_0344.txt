Two different numbering systems are used for the sixty-four larger diagrams.
The sequence numbers on the right are the chapter numbers of the book, which
most readers will use here. This sequence, called the Hou Tian, will require either a
key like this or memory to move from the raw diagram to the number of its chap-
ter. The sequence numbers on the left, called the Xian Tian, represent the most
useful order, sequence and arrangement of the diagrams. These are the diagrams
as the binary numbers from zero to sixty-three and no key is needed.

Introduction
Except for a few forays into the role of structure in generating metaphors in the
original Zhouyi, a discussion of the role of number in the form of scales in the Introduction
to Xiao Gua, the Small Symbols and the statement of an hy pothesis that the Yijing is,
perhaps even ultimately, a systematic counseling language about changing attitudes, this
book has so far concerned itself with the words and phrases of the Book of Changes, or
with the Yi Li (Meaning and Principle) school of interpretation. This section concentrates on
the “third half” of the puzzle, the Xiang Shu or the Image and Number school. The focus
here will be on the images and their structure.
The many structural dimensions of the Yi’s images may be divided into four histori-
cal categories: a) the Zhouyi dimensions, or those which were evidently a part of the thought
processes of the original authors, b) the Wing dimensions, or those which make their first
appearance in the Ten Appendices, either as conjecture about the original authors’ thought
processes or as freshly minted algorithms and new exigetical techniques, c) the Yiweishu
dimensions, or those which first appear in the Han dynasty apocryphal works, and d) Post-
Han analyses and speculations, particularly in the Song, Ming and Qing dynasties. These
categories will be pointed out as dimensions are discussed, although many placements can
only be guessed at. The first set was partly obscured and partly just unmentioned by the
original Zhouyi editors. The Wing set is often far wide of the real Zhouyi, although even its
wilder speculations offer interesting structural refinements and insights. But most of al

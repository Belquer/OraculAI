The Jiao Gua or Reverse Pairs
This is the set of twenty eight Gua pairs which have the same component Ba Gua or
Trigrams but in the Reverse positions. Jiao (0702) means exchanged or interchanged. The
eight Chong Gua or Repeated Trigram Gua are their own Jiao Gua. While the Inverse and
Opposite sets are arguably Zhouyi dimensions which were later elaborated in the Wings ( Xu
Gua), the Jiao G ua did not make an appearance as an explicit dimension until the Han
Yiweishu, following further development and elaboration of the Wings’ Ban Xiang or Half-
Images, discussed later. Yu Fan (164-233), who called these Fan (Reversed) Gua is
mentioned in this context. Once given a clearer conception of the meanings of lower and
upper, inner and outer, subjective and objective, Zhen and Hui places in the Gua, it became
useful to examine the differing roles of the Ba Gua as they operated in the two distinct
places and to examine how the lessons from one could be used in the other. Thus one might
look at a Reverse Gua for insights into: 1) the objective applicability of more intimate
subjective experience (inner to outer) or 2) the internalization of an objective experience in
composing an optimum attitude (outer to inner). Logically speaking, Reverse is a Converse,
a reversal of subject and predicate.
See Jiao Gua Pairs, Figure 6.  The Chong Gua (Fig. 23) are missing. Underlined
numbers are also Inverse pairs; Bold numbers are also Opposite pairs

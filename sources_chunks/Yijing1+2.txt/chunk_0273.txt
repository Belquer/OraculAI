The Symbolism: Li, as flame and sunlight, might be thought of as symbolic of the
energy which powers, organizes, lights and informs living beings, except that this
is not symbol but reality: fire is spirit’s face. Energy which now is awareness, or a
campfire, was yesterday trapped in a plant’s complex sugars, the day before, light,
on the way to photosynthesis. Tomorrow this may be invested again, in creation,
memory, knowledge or a friendship. Li encompasses both perspectives: on one’s
sources, and on one’s present transformation, both on the fuel and on the flame’s
application in the greater beyond, on convergence and diversification. This is the
fourth dimension, a being’s transformative track through time: then, now & when.

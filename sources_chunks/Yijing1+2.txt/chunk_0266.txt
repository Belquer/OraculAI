The Symbolism: Kun comes close to the conception of Earth which we know as
Gaia, the great Mother. As the ocean did not play an important part in the lives of
the ancient Chinese, those aspects of life which in the West accrued oceanic and
aquatic symbols were represented in China by symbols of the Earth: these include
unity, fecundity, understanding, tolerance, e mbrace, plenum, capacity and the
mystic’s truth. And of course there are the more “earthy” meanings of ba sis,
ground, substance, substratum, support, accessibility and as many gifts, simply, yet
conditionally, provided, as one is capable of accepting. The dimension is breadth,
the range of the possible, or the field of options with an infinite number of paths.

Note: While the meanings of the Ba Gua and those of their respective Chong G ua
are closely related, they are not identical. Ba Gua meanings are sim pler, more
elemental. The Chong Gua incorporate complexities of meaning from the Zhen and
Hui G ua positions and dimensions of both reflectiveness and reflexiveness: th

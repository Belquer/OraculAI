osses. These will be found in the Matrix, at
the end of each of the Gua.
The 10th and final Wing is a quick review of the 32 structurally meaningful
pairs, as one of the pair contrasts with the other. These pairs are arranged in ye
t
another random sequence. This Wing is known as the Za G ua, the Assorted or
Miscellaneous Hexagrams. In Chinese, and in this random sequence, this Wing is
a poem which is intended for use as a mnemonic device, like the English “Thirty
days hath September ...” only not as annoying. Some translators have att empted
to rhyme this in English, and have tweaked the meanings of the words to force
the rhyme, but it is more useful to us if the terms are translated precisely and used
as another set of glosses. Consequently, this Wing is treated here in the same
manner as Wing 9. These glosses may be found in the Matrix, at the end of each
of the Gua. Although many scholars will tend to dismiss these additional Gua
meanings as part of a trivial little rhyme, they do contain a number of helpful
associations.

The Nature of the Yijing
The Ten Wings provided the foundation for two divergent and rival schools
of interpretation. The Xiang S hu or "Image and Number" school (formed in the
Western Han dynasty) claimed that the puzzle of the Yi would be solved in terms
of its structural dimensions. The Yi Li or "Meaning and Principle" school (formed
three centuries later but not given this name until the Song dynasty) claimed that
the puzzle would be solved by investigating the words and the philosophy of its
text. The segment following this will have more to say about these two points of
view and their schemes of interpretation. Like most rival schools of thought, each
group of believers thought itself to be in possession of at least two-thirds of the
whole truth. Now, we know that this does not add up. Nor does it add up if both
of these schools of thought are a little more than half wrong, which was the case.
An enormous piece of the puzzle was still missing, and this was the First piece,
the third half and the one most indispensable to understanding the Nature of the
Yi. While these schools of interpretation busied themselves peering and prying so
deeply into the hidden layers of this mysterious creation, nobody it seems would
think to try peering  outward from these depths. Nobody thought or dared to take
the point of view of the Yi’s Creators. To a follower or believer, this was unthink-
able, the heresy of seeing human beings and human endeavor behind a such a
wonder.
What want or purpose was in the hearts of these shammans as they sang

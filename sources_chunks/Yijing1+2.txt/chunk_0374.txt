ong, without a mistake,
not a mistake, make no mistakes, no harm done, etc.) may be tracked through the Zhouyi by
following jiu in column 5, from its first occurrence at 01.3.
At the end of the Matrix section for each of the Gua there are miscellaneous sections:
 ##.xc gives further glosses and insights on the Gua Ming,  excerpted from the Xi Ci Zhuan ,
the Commentary on the Appended Phrases, a.k.a. Da Zhuan, the Great Commentary,
Wings 5 and 6. The Xi Ci Zhuan  only examines nine of the Gua.
##.xg does the same for the Xu Gua , the Sequence of the Hexagrams, Wing 9.
##.zg does the same for the Za Gua, the Assorted or Miscellaneous Hexagrams, Wing 10.
##.m gives the Hexagram Name as found in the Mawangdui manuscript. This is treated here
as a simply another gloss of the Gua Ming in the received version. These names differ
in thirty-two of the sixty-four cases. In several, the differences are significant.
##.#wy offers selected quotations from the Wen Yan Zhuan , the Commentary on Words of
the Text, Wing 7, which expands and expounds on only the first two Gua.

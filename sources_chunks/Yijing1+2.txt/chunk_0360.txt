first appeared
in the Yiweishu in the Early Han. The development of the Shi Er Yue Gua, in the order of
the 12 Moons (see Fig. 15), is attributed to Meng Xi (90-40) by Yu Fan (164-233) (Fendos,
p. 406). The pairing of the 12 Branches to the 12 Lines of Qian and Kun and a system
known as “Internalizing the 12 Branches” is attributed to Jing Fang (77-37) ( ib, p. 370).
However, the Chinese had developed their 12-month calendar long before the Zhouyi was
composed. Further, the references to the coming of the 8th Moon at Gua Ci 19.0 (Lin is the
12th Moon, the 8th’s Inverse), the reference to the coming of solid ice at Yao Ci 02.1 (Zhi
Gua 24) and the association of Gua 24 to the Winter Solstice in Da Xiang 24.X all suggest
that a system of assignments was both in place and a part of both the Zhouyi  and Wing
composers’ thought processes.
The Sovereign Gua of the 12 Moons are derived by a method of permuting any
given Gua through eleven others and back to itself. This came to be known later as the “ 1 2
Earthly Branches Method” (this is distinguished from the earlier 12 Earthly Branches
themselves). Beginning with any base Gua, the first l ine is changed into its opposite.
Allowing the change to remain, the second line is then changed, then the third, etc. When the
top is reached, the Gua has become the original’s Opposite. The six steps are then repeated
from the bottom up to return the Gua to original form. The base Gua used in deriving the
Families (see Figs. 15-18) are the Chong Gua (Doubled Trigrams) paired with their
Opposites. Of these the best known family is Kun-Qian, more commonly called the
Sovereign Gua of the 12
 Moons. The No Family Gua are left out of this particular series
even though each of these may also be permuted by the 12 Branch Method. The first two
columns below give the 12 Moons, the 12 (approximate) western months and the Sovereign
Gua of the Moons. The remaining columns are later attributions.

The Gua Xiang or Hexagram Images
The Zhouyi authors made use of a number of overall Gua characteristics, not
respective of the meanings assigned to the individual Lines or Trigrams, in their search for
illustrative metaphors and extended analogies. These are a few:
The Shape (Xiang4, 2568 or Xing2, 2759) of the Gua became a significant factor
when it resembled a familiar object. Gua 02 was wide open or accepting, like a ploughed
furrow; 23 was a too-tall mountain; 20 was an observation tower; 62 was a bird in flight; 50
was a ding cauldron; 44 was an undermining; 24 was a seed deep in the earth, or the road
home; 27 was an open mouth; 61 was a window into a private space; 34 had horns; 43 was a
too tall lake or something about to burst; 28 was something overloaded; and 01 was whole
and full. This dimension could stand as an argument for the early existence of the two
graphically distinct whole and broken lines depicting the Gua as an image, but it does not
follow that this implies any binary cosmology

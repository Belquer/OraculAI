r worth fighting for or against. The weights and standards are set.
Economies and values, rates of appreciation and interest, what constitutes a prize or
endowment: all these are settled and fixed into tangible things as though by silent
votes. Though all of these were once verbs. We forget that to be able to treasure is
as good as treasure itself. We economize and make value, we appreciate and take an
interest, we prize what we love, we endow what we nurture, we option our choices,
we redeem our lives, we reward ourselves with things that cost nothing. Gold is only
a weight that turns light yellow. Yet we obsess with the seeming of things. A river
belongs to the one who wades in, the mountains to those who can climb or admire.
The wide eyed sage is the one with great holdings, dominions beyond possession,
in wielding his power to give and take value. If you own the key why buy the vault?

While the neglected importance of these two fundamental dimensions might be
considered one of main theses of this dissertation, the proof of this importance must be in
that they solve persistent, intractable Yao Ci problems of translation and interpretation, that
they eliminate some of the need for the more far-fetched speculations.

The Gua Xu or Hexagram Sequences
In an English dictionary the words are alphabetized for convenience of reference. The
alphabet itself remains in its familiar sequence strictly for mnemonic reasons, even though it
would make a lot more sense if it were organized geometrically according to phoneme type.
Chinese dictionaries are usually organized around enumerated radicals, with enumeration
based upon the number of strokes used in writing the radical. None of these al phabetic or
numerical organizing principles bear any consistent relationship to lexical meaning. On a
slightly higher scale of order, the way in which we number our months has meaning in its
reference to sequence, but both the number of months used and the point of origin on the
circle is essentially arbitrary: the only “real” anchors for the seasonal cycle as a calendar
would be one of the equinoxes or solstices (which also suggests that the number four be a
factor in the number of months). Numerologists t end to make a b ig real deal about these
arbitrary constructs. As I write this, the western year 2000 is fast approaching, as billions
wait anxiously, believing that this arbitrary number will somehow “do” something to them.
In the middle ages there were riots when a calendar reform led to an eleven-day adjustment:
the people believed that eleven days were being stolen from their lives. Most traditional
Qabalists assign great significance to the sequence of the Hebrew alphabet, all the while
ignoring this alphabet’s much higher geometrical order (still not phoneme based). At least
the Tarot card readers know better: they can simply shuffle their decks.
The Sequence of the Hexagrams in the received Yijing text is known as the Hou Tian
Xu (Later Heaven) or Wen Wang Xu (King Wen) Sequence. This is a good example of a
little order into which far too much has been read. The algorithm for the little order is: Every
even n
umbered Gua is the Inverse of the Gua which precedes it, except in cases where a
Gua is its own Inverse - then the preceding Gua is an Opposite. This gives thirty two
structurally meaningful pairs which were then placed in random sequence. As suggested
earlier, I have had a difficult time imagining that this was the original chapter sequence,
preferring to think that this legacy was an editor’s tactic, one which was designed to leave
only a single clue that other dimensions existed, and leave novices unintimidated.
The Mawangdui manuscript, entombed in 168 BCE and uncovered in the twentieth
century, arranges the chapters in a different sequence, one which clearly demonstrates an
awareness of the Ba Gua as components of the Gua [this sequence and its full text may be
found in both Kunst and Shaughnessy (1996)]. But I am not inclined to give this much
weight as a candidate for the original sequence either. The text of Laozi' Daodejing  was
found re arranged in this package as well. Rather, this appears to be one of the s

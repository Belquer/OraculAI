certainly would have made the conception of the whole a simpler task for the authors. But if
this was so this pattern was lost long ago.

The Qian Gua or Inverse Pairs
This is the set of twenty eight Gua pairs with their line sequences reversed or their
figures turned upside down. Qian (0918) means hidden, latent or subliminal. The pairs are
also called Fu (1993), overturned, or Dian (6337), inverted. Since these form the basis of
much of the Yi’s Hou Tian lineal sequence, the Xu G ua’s ( Wing Nine's) attempt to explain
(or justify) the sequence may help in contrasting pair meanings. These glosses are given in
the Matrix section (##.xg). Gua pairs 41&42, 51&52 and 57&58 were given as examples
of dichotomy in the Gua Ming section above. To the extent that this dimension was on the
minds of the Zhouyi authors, contrasts or dichotomies will be found in the pairs as Ideas, as
a form of complements which exist at different times on a cycle (syzygy). To the extent that
the Gua positions map the time or time’s unfolding, a Gua’s Invert shows this unfolding in
a turned around rhythm or cadence. To turn structurally expressed ideas upside down will
also often contrast essentialist and existential points of view: Plato’s metaphysics becomes
an epistemology, the Qabalah’s Tree of Life as a sequence of creation becomes instead a
scheme for spiritual evolution.

The Pang Tong Gua or Opposite Pairs
This is the set of thirty two Gua pairs with all six lines changed. Pang Tong means
paired together. These pairs are also called Bian (5245), transformed or changed. Unlike
Inverse and Reverse, all sixty four Gua have Opposites. In the Xian Tian binary sequence
all pair numbers add to 63, i.e. they are mathematical complements. Also mathematically, a
Gua’s opposite is it’s least likely Zhi Gua. Gua pairs 01&02, 11&12, 29&30, 51&57 and
52&58 were given as exa mples of dichotomy in the Gua Ming  section above. In Shao
Yong’s circular arrangement of the Gua these pairs oppose each other on the circle. Taking
a cue from later Yin-Yang theory, it will be helpful to see these pairs as complementary
opposites, as insights and attitudes which are fulfilling to the larger goal of wholeness and
the personal integration of paradox - they should not be seen as mutually exclusive.
See Pang Tong Gua  Pairs, Figure 5.  Gua Ming  in bold are the symmetrical Gua,
used in the Hou Tian Sequence and glossed as pairs in the Xu Gua, Wing 9. Underlined
numbers are also Reverse pairs; Bold numbers are also Inverse pairs.

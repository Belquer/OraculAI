Phrases
More than a hundred phrases, simple word combinations and idioms recur
in the Zhouyi and the Wings. Most of these recurrences can be traced th rough
the Yi using the information in the right hand column of the Matrix. Wu j iu can
be traced by following jiu from 01.3 in the fifth column.
Sometimes these phrases adapt to context, like the Chinese characters, and
are given many different faces throughout the translations. Wu j iu is an example.
Sometimes the phrase is translated the same throughout, but it carries different or
nuanced implications. An example is li she da chuan , “worthwhile to cross the
great stream.” At 5.0, Anticipation, the rains have not yet come and the stream is
still friendly. At 13.0, Fellowship with Others, something akin to anthropology is
being suggested, going beyond cultural limitations. At 18.0, Detoxifying, this
means to get out of a niche which has become a trap. Sometimes, too, the phrases
simply say the same thing over and over again.
Understandng the range of a phrase’s meanings is particularly important in
very short (sometimes two character) Gua Ci  and Yao Ci  where these recurring
phrases are the only content, for example: 14.0 ( yuan heng ); 32.2 ( hui wang );
34.0 (li zhen); 34.2 ( zhen ji); and 40.1 ( wu jiu). However, in these five cases the
Zhi Gua and Fan Yao dimensions (Dimensions, Gua Bian) are also very helpful.
The Yi Li (Meaning and Principle) school of interpretation relies heavily
on the broader ranges of word and phrase meanings. As such, this Glossary could
be considered the Yi Li  section of this book, when it is used in conjunction with
the columns in the Matrix. One more Yi Li dimension remains: the Gua Ming, or
the Hexagram Name. This are discussed in Di mensions, Gua Ming ,
 even though
this section of the book is largely devoted to the Xiang Xu  (Image and Number)
dimensions. However, most of the traditional translations of the Gua Ming are
scoped in this Glossary.

The Symbolism: Qian, as heaven or sky, is the symbol of higher order(s) and
nature. This is the heaven which the astronomer inquires into, not that of western
religions, and yet it is both sacred and d ivine, worthy of wonder, reverence and
gratitude, but not a god, and not needing worship. Although it is a grand design, it
is self-organizing, lacking a designer. It is orderly and moves with direction, but
lacks both purpose and plan. It is intelligible, without presupposing an intelligence.
It protects the righteous when upright people choose to live within the order of
things, in harmony with the natural law. Both accident and luck do exist here, but
longevity tends to favor the true. This is the first dimension, length and direction.

The Hu Gua or Nuclear Diagrams
In addition to the Lower and Upper Trigrams in the Hexagram, two other Trigrams
may be found: one composed of Lines 2, 3 & 4 and one of Lines 3, 4 & 5. These are
known as the Lower and Upper Hu Ti (2152, 6246), Overlapping or Interwoven / Bodies or
Forms. Their interpretive meanings are discussed briefly under Ban Xiang, below. When
these two Trigrams are then combined into a new Hexagram the result is the Hu Gua, the
Overlapping Hexagram. These are better known to English readers as the Nuclear Trigrams
and the Nuclear Hexagrams. Lynn (at p. 44n39) cites Wang Yinglin (1223-1296) in the
preface to Zheng shi Zhouyi:
[Zheng Xuan (127-200)] emulated [Fei Zhi (50 BCE -10 CE] and made an annotated
edition of the Changes in nine scrolls, which often frames its discussion in terms of
overlapping trigrams. This practice of using overlapping trigrams to seek the meaning of the
Changes has existed since Mr. Zuo [4th cent. 
BCE]. In all hexagrams, sets of the second,
third and fourth lines and sets of the third, fourth and fifth lines mingle together but each set
separately forms a trigram. This is what is meant in this practice by “one hexagram
contains four trigrams.”
So apparently the Hu Ti  may antedate the Wing dimensions, and yet no reason
exists to call this a Zhouyi dimension. The Zhouyi authors, to the extent which they were
perceiving Trigrams, might indeed have s een and used a hidden one on occasion while
hunting for explanatory metaphors. But there seems to have been no rigorous or systematic
application of this principle. Fendos (at p. 320) cites Gao Huaimin (Liang H an, p. 164):
“The main objective in creating nuclear trigrams seems to have been to bring about an
increase in hexagram images that could be used to augment interpreting a hexagram or parts
of the hexagram texts.” The Hu Ti, as structural basis for commentary, developed among
the Yiweishu dimensions, perhaps as early as Jing Fang (77-37). The Hu Gua seem to have
appeared much later and might be called a Post-Han dimension.
In the Hu Gua, the lower and upper Hu Ti  are combined into a Gua. Only sixteen
Gua can be so constructed. Each of these sixteen acts as a nucleus in four others. 00 and 63
are their own Hu Gua. The function is seen by some as akin to a latent idea or matrix, a
potential or tendency, like a seed within a fruit; by others as a contextual matrix within
which the change occurs. The Hu Gua studies have (of course) been taken one step further
into the Second Nuclear Hexagrams of the Sixteen Nuclear Hexagrams. There are only four
of these, which on the binary grid are the third-points: 0/3, 1/3, 2/3 & 3/3 (see Fig. 26).

The Shi Er Di Zhi or Twelve Earthly Branches
Most of the elaborate associations of the Yi with the Chinese calendar first appeared
in the Yiweishu in the Early Han. The development of the Shi Er Yue Gua, in the order of
the 12 Moons (see Fig. 15), is attributed to Meng Xi (90-40) by Yu Fan (164-233) (Fendos,

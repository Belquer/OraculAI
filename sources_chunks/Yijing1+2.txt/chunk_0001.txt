Two different numbering systems are used for the sixty-four larger diagrams.
The sequence numbers on the right are the chapter numbers of the book, which
most readers will use here. This sequence, called the Hou Tian, will require either a
key such as this or memory to move from the raw di agram to the number of its
chapter. The sequence numbers seen on the left, called the Xian Tian, represent
the most useful order, sequence and arrangement of the diagrams. These are the
diagrams as the binary numbers from zero to sixty-three and no key is needed.

Preface
Welcome to the world's oldest unsolved Chinese puzzle. By the time you
are done here it will still be unsolved. This little Book of Changes, which in its
native Chinese will fit onto less than forty pages, has been teasing and tormenting
scholars for thousands of years, and translators for centuries. Many more than ten
thousand lifetimes have been spent in its study. Over the centuries it has been
consulted more often than the Bible, the Koran or the Vedas, and been read more
than Shakespeare or Homer. And yet it lays down no law. It founds no religion. It
tells no story. So what is this odd, inscrutable little tome all about?
The safest thing to say at the beginning is that the Yijing (formerly spelled
I Ching) began its career as a divination manual at some time during China's Early
Zhou dynasty, roughly or nearly three thousand years ago. However, without an
understanding of what is, or was, meant by "divination," particularly of what it
meant to the book's authors and its intended readers, we do not know the book's
purpose. Within this question dwell many competing schools, and this work will
attempt to construct yet another. If divination means "predicting the future" then
the Yijing is nothing more than what the sheep think it is: a fortune telling device.
And if divination means simply "uncovering the hidden" th

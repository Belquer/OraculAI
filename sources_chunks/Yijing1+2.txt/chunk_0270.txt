The Symbolism: Xun, as wind, is the symbol for the versatility and plasticity of the
mind, the ability to approach a situation from all available angles in order to find
and occupy a niche, to fit into or conform to the scheme of things. Its second
symbol is wood, specifically green wood of roots and branches, which explores its
environment, finding the paths of least resistance, in order to extend its reach and
assimilate little, specific pieces of that environment into itself. Wood is also thought
of as a little boat, which gets about by penetrating water and working with the
currents. A sensitivity to place and detail, and an ability to grow both by learning
and by the dissemination of information is im plied by both of these symbols.

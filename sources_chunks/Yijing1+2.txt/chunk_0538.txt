dical, plus the num-
ber of additional strokes (plus or m inus a stroke). This is the “access code”
(rather than alphabetizing) to many classical Chinese dictionaries.
The fourth number ( e.g. 12.5x) gives the location of the character’s first
occurrence in the Yi (this example: Chapter 12, Line 5, Xiao Xiang commentary).
Words listed in the second part, "Characters not in the Glossary," do not
meet the above criteria but their glosses may be scoped by tracking the use of the
words through the Matrix. Here there are given the Pinyin pr onunciations, th
e
Mathews numbers, the Karlgren GSR numbers, alternative pronunciations, and
miscellaneous references and notes. This is a complete list of all Matrix characters
not found in the main Glossary. The note "ap" means "also pronounced"; the note
"lz" means that the character is found in my Laozi glossary.
The third part lists the 67 characters which occur 25 times or more in the
Matrix section. Their occurrences make up about half of the Yijing's text. This is
therefore a recommended first study list for those who are just b eginning to learn
classical Chinese.
The final part is a guide to Pinyin and to conversion from the Wade-Giles
system of transliteration.

at 01.7 and 02.7 as meaning “if all six lines change” is conjecture. The
theory that the Yao C i  represents an interpolation in meaning between the Original
Hexagram (known as the Ben or Root Gua) and the Final Hexagram (known as the Zhi or
Resultant Gua) has already been described twice in the Introduction. Also mentioned was
the observation that this Zhouyi structural dimension has been largely overlooked by
scholars, certainly in English, with the exception of Hellmut Wilhelm, who develops the idea
at some length in interpreting Qian’s Yao Ci (in Eight Lectures, pp 53-57).
In today’s versions the Yao C i are introduced by line type (Six or Nine) and Line
Position (Yao Wei), that is: 1st 9, 6 2nd, 9 3rd, 6 4th, 9 5th, Top 6. This seems to be a later
simplification. The character zhi, either in its meaning of “goes to,” “leads to” or “results
in,” or else as a simple possessive (... 's), was used prior to this system, at least in the pre-
Wing, 4th cent. BCE Zuozhuan and Guoyu and probably earlier. In the Zuozhuan , the
nomenclature “Da Zhuang  Zhi Tai ”, for example, would refer to that line in Da Zhuang
which, upon changing, would result in Tai, that is, Line Four. In other words, built in to both
the nomenclature and the thinking was the destination of the Change. The simplification in
the later system has all but eliminated this important thought process from later Yao C i
interpretation. This simplification may have occurred prior to the writing of the Wings in the
Late Zhou, Qin and Early Han. This was a great loss since the Zhi G ua was at least  as
important a Zhouyi dimension as the better known Yao Wei or Line Positions. Much of the
reasoning behind the Yao Ci's  metaphorical constructions was rendered invisible. This in
12

turn led to much wild speculation in the Wings and Yiweishu about the Yao Ci's  rationale,
about the structural roots which sprouted the words of the text.
Once again, one of the major Zhouyi dimensions of a Changing Line Text is that it is
an interpolation in meaning between a Root and a Final Hexagram, a Ben G ua and a Zhi
Gua, in the direction from the former to the latter. This dimension is not always important
or useful to the interpretation of the received Yao Ci text. But in every case it is important to
the complete understanding of the Changing Line as a deeper Idea. The best way to
understand this further is to begin by looking at some of the more obvious examples as an
exercise. Offered below is an incomplete list of relatively clear Zhi G ua references; the
underlined Yao Ci numbers refer to brief explanations in the footnotes in this Translation:
01.1; 02.3; 03.2; 05.2; 06.3; 06.6; 08.3; 08.5; 09.3; 10.4; 10.6; 12.3; 14.4; 15.2; 15.5; 16.4;
16.5; 17.1; 17.6; 18.1; 19.1; 19.5; 20.3; 21.2; 22.2; 23.3; 23.6; 24.6; 25.6; 26.6; 27.4; 28.2;
28.3; 29.1; 30.2; 30.4; 30.6; 31.5; 32.2; 32.4; 33.2; 34.2; 35.1; 37.6; 38.1; 38.2; 38.5; 39.1;
40.4; 40.6; 41.1; 41.5; 42.2; 43.5; 44.2; 44.3; 45.1; 45.4; 45.5; 46.2; 46.3; 46.4; 47.6; 48.1;
48.2; 49.3; 49.4; 50.1; 50.3; 51.3; 51.5; 51.6; 52.2; 52.6; 53.2; 54.2; 55.1; 55.4; 56.2; 56.4;
57.1; 57.3; 57.5; 58.4; 59.1; 59.3; 60.1; 60.5; 60.6; 61.2; 61.3; 61.4; 62.2; 62.3; 62.4; 63.1;
63.2; 63.4; 63.5; 64.3; 64.6.
Zhi Gua is the second most overlooked of the original Yao Ci dimensions. The most
overlooked is that two Yao Ci form a resonant pair when they have a reciprocal Zhi G ua
relationship, that is, they meet on a path while moving in opposite directions, with each one
coming from the other’s destination. This dimension is so neglected that I have had to coin
a term for it: Fan Yao (Reverse Line, or Line-Coming-Back) Pairs. These pairs will often
share vocabulary elements, cross-references, subjects, or grammatical tone, voice and mood.
As with Zhi Gua above, here are some of the clearest examples, offered as an exercise, with
the locations of explanatory footnotes underlined:
01.6, 43.6; 02.3, 15.3; 03.3, 63.3; 05.3, 60.3; 05.4, 43.4; 06.4, 59.4

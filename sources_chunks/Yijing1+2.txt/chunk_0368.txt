partner.” The Eight Gua which are
composed of Trigrams paired with their Opposites (see Fig. 24) are fully Ying. The Chong
(Repeated) (Ba) Gua (see Fig. 23) are completely Bu (Not) Ying.
Fen or Even Apportionment. This refers to Lines in a Gua which has an equal number of
Rou and Gang Lines (see Fig. 28). Where balance is wanted, this is assumed auspicious.
Bi or Holding Together. Adjacent Lines, if one is Rou and the other Gang, are sometimes
observed as Holding Together. This is said to be more auspicious if the Line in question
(meaning both Lines of the pair) is Dang or Appropriate, and Most auspicious in the sixteen
cases where the pair is 6 4th / 9 5th. The lower Line of the pair is said to be Carrying or
Receiving (Cheng) the upper. The upper Line is said to be Riding or Availing Of (also
pronounced Cheng) the lower. According to 
Wang Bi (tr. Lynn, p. 29): “ Carrying and
riding provide images of incongruity or congruity.” But observe the most auspicious pair
of 6 4th / 9 5th. From the longer view all that this says is that the Hui (Ba) Gua is either
Kan or Xun.
Lin or Neighborhood. The presence of these interrelating or interconnecting dimensions,
especially where more than one is present, establishes a kind of Neighborhood, from which
helpers come, friends arrive, gifts are sent, etc., and this is said to help explain the use of
these images in the Changing Line Texts.
Sheng Jiang Yao  or Rising and Falling Lines. Gang Lines are often said to be rising or
going, Rou lines to be falling, sinking, resting or coming back, both in the context of the
Gua as a map of the time and as extended spatial metaphor.
Ruling Lines. Certain lines in each Gua are said to capture the essence of the meaning or
to be dominant in influence over the other lines. Sometimes this is a function of the Gua
Xiang (Hexagram Image) or the Yao Wei  association of 'ruler' and 'sovereign' with Line 5.
But where these are lacking, the assignment of ruling lines is strictly a Yiweishu
construction. These assignments are given below. Lines numbers in bold are termed
Governing Rulers, the others are called Constituting rulers:
01: 5; 02: 2; 03: 1,5; 04: 2,6; 05: 5; 06: 5; 07: 2,5; 08: 5; 09: 4,5; 10: 3,5; 11: 2,5; 12:

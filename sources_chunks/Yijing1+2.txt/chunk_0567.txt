 7312 4g 5+2 01.T As used in the Tuan Zhuan and Xiao
Xiang, a final particle used to denote the end of a complete thought or to give a pause of
emphasis to a word or phrase. This is the only word which has been deleted from the text in
the Matrix translation, but it remains in place in the Chinese text. Ye has been treated as no
more than a period mark here, except where preceding words indicate a question or
exclamation mark. In its place are the “P” and “S” notations to mark the beginning of a
new paragraph or sentence. Elsewhere it can mean: also, and, as, even, if, just, only, still,
when, while, with; such is/are; just so, plain, simple; final particle: a little, at all, completely,
entirely, especially, here, indeed, of all, period, some, itself; a pause, as xi1 (2414). A final
particle used to denote the end of a complete thought or to give a pause of emphasis to a
word or phrase. A period sign.

ntical. Ba Gua meanings are sim pler, more
elemental. The Chong Gua incorporate complexities of meaning from the Zhen and
Hui G ua positions and dimensions of both reflectiveness and reflexiveness: the
elements take on an aspect of self-consciousness or self-awareness (similar in ways
to the Retrogradation of a Planet in Western Astrology). The Chong Gua  text
often discusses these added complexities.

*Note: Here again is the Chinese conception of Earth symbolized in the west by
Water. Interestingly, the Chinese Mawangdui text calls the Kun Chong Gua
Chuan (1439), Stream, Water or Flow. Curious, too, is that the mare is sacred to
Neptune, her creator in Greek mythology. Remember that in these symbolic
languages, the symbol is not what is being referred to: the symbol is only meant to
evoke a state of mind. Not the finger but the Moon.

The Symbolism: Gen, as mountain, is a symbol of individual existence, solid and
real for practical purposes, but only insofar as its foundation upon a greater reality
is secure, which requires that the basis be broader than the summit. Here, security,
composure and balance are inseparable. From below, the human perspective, the
big picture is grasped only when one is on top of things. Until the work is done to
get to this lofty place, the mountain is an obstacle, or limit to the grander view. To
be great means to be greatly grounded. Mountains are also thought of as the
centers of the w orld, hubs, poles, axes and reference points. And, of course, they
are home to the gods. This is half of the third dimension, things, as islands in time.

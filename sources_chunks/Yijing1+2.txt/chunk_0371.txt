Introductory Notes
This version of the Yi gives one line of information for each heading and each word
in the Chinese text. It reads from top to bottom, like the Chinese original. The sequence of
the headings is a little different from that in the Simple Translation. The Da Xiang  resumes
its place as a later commentary. Since the Tuan Zhuan often quotes from the Gua Ci and the
Xiao Xiang from the Yao Ci, these pairs were placed adjacent to each other for easy cross-
reference.
This is a more advanced and difficult text. It is intended for more careful and slower
study of the Chinese text’s broader meanings, deliberate ambiguities, and choices between
translations. Even then it is only meant to be read a few paragraphs at a time.
The idea for a multidimensional translation grew out of a recommendation made to a
friend that he not try to grasp Laozi by reading one favorite translation but to pick at least
three and "add them together" to "broaden" the words. The "one word, one line" idea,
forming a two-dimensional tapestry of potential meanings

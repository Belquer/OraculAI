);	and	to	the	weakness
in	Anuyoga	as	‘the	duality	of	pure	expanse	or	space’	(
dag-pa’i	dbyings
)
identified	with	Samantabhadr
ῑ
,	and	of	pristine	cognition	or	awareness	(
jñāna
),
which	is	identified	with	Samantabhadra.	See	NSTB,	pp.	295-7.	In	the	context	of
the	present	verse,	these	weaknesses	are	both	subsumed	in	the	dualistic	notion	of
‘space	and	awareness’	(
dbyings-rig
).

Our	text	at	this	point	has	the	reading:	
gdams-ngag	gdams-ngag
	(‘oral
teaching,	oral	teaching’).	The	meaningful	reading:	
gang-zag	bdag-med
(‘selflessness	of	the	individual’)	is	suggested	by	Zenkar	Rinpoche.
12
	
The	elimination	of	the	dichotomy	between	‘singularity’	(
gcig
)	and
‘multiplicity’	(
du-ma
)	is	the	subject	of	one	of	the	great	axioms	of	Madhyamaka
dialectic,	
known	as	the	‘absence	of	the	singular	and	the	multiple’	(
gcig-dang	du-
bral
),	on	which	see	M.	D.	Eckel,	
Jñānagarbha’s	Commentary	on	the	Distinction
between	the	Two	Truths
,	pp.	80-85.
13
	
The	innate	presence	of	intrinsic	awareness,	without	need	for	the	elaborations
of	view	(
lta-ba
),	meditation	(
sgom-pa
),	conduct	(
spyod-pa
),	or	result	(
’bras-bu
	
),
as	expounded	in	these	verses,	is	clearly	discussed	in	the	Atiyoga	texts	of	Cutting
through	Resistance	(
khregs-chod
).	See	
e.g.
	Dudjom	Rinpoche,	NSTB,	p.	335.

The	adopting	of	these	four	media	(
thig-bzhi
)	is	comparable	to	reaching	the
limits	of	awareness	by	the	three	presences	(
sdod-pa	gsum
),	or	the	revealing	of
the	limits	of	liberation	by	means	of	the	four	assurances	(
gdeng-bzhi
),	which
consolidate	the	practices	of	the	Great	Perfection.	On	these	Atiyoga	terms,	see
Dudjom	Rinpoche,	NSTB,	p.	343.
15
	
The	riveting	of	these	four	nails	(
gzer-bzhi
)	is	comparable	to	that	of	the	three
attainments	(
thob-pa	gsum
),	which	consolidate	the	practices	of	the	Great
Perfection.	See	Dudjom	Rinpoche,	NSTB,	p.	343.
16
	
The	two	extremes	of	which	the	view	is	free	are	open	and	closed	or	high	and
low	perspectives;	the	two	extremes	of	which	meditation	is	devoid	are	hope	and
doubt;	the	two	extremes	of	which	conduct	is	free	are	renunciation	and
acceptance;	and	the	two	extremes	of	which	the	result	is	free	are	beginning	and
end.	These	eight	extremes	may	be	reduced	to	six	by	omitting	the	category	of	the
result.

On	the	view	of	vacuous	emptiness	(
stong-pa	phyal-ba
)	maintained	by	non-
Buddhists,	see	Dudjom	Rinpoche,	NSTB,	pp.	62-4,	66-7;	and	for	a	detailed
discussion,	the	purpose	of	which	is	to	indicate	that	the	Buddhist	view	of
emptiness	is	neither	vacuous	nor	nihilistic,	see	ibid.,	pp.	178-216.
18
	
The	nature	of	the	delusion	(
gti-mug
),	drowsiness	(
’thib-pa
),	and	agitation
(
rgod-pa
),	which	obstruct	the	clarity	of	meditations	such	as	calm	abiding
(
śamatha
),	is	discussed	in	L.	Pruden	(trans.),	
Abhidharmakośabhāṣyaṃ
,	Ch.	5,
The	Latent	Defilements,	pp.	767-868,	and	Ch.	8,	The	Absorptions,	pp.	1215-82.

Existence	and	non-existence	(
yod-med	gang-du	ma-grub
)	form	one	binary
subset	within	the	four-point	set	(
catuṣkoṭi
)	of	propositions	which	are	negated	by
Nāgārjuna	in	the	
Root	Stanzas	of	the	Madhyamaka	entitled	Discriminative
Awareness
	(
Prajñā-nāma	mūlamadhyamakakārikā
,	T	3824).	See	D.	Kalupahana

On	the	controversy	concerning	the	emptiness	which	is	devoid	of	virtuous	and
negative	actions	(
stong-pa-nyid-la	dge-sdig	yul-ma	grub
),	see	the	discussion	on
the	view	of	the	Great	Perfection	in	NSTB,	pp.	896-910.

The	lives	of	the	future	treasure-finders	(
gter-ston
)	predicted	by
Padmasambhava,	including	that	of	Karma	Lingpa,	the	treasure-finder	associated
with	our	present	text,	are	recounted	in	NSTB,	pp.	750-880,	and	on	the
prophecies	found	in	the	treasure-doctrines,	ibid.,	pp.	934-5.	On	Karma	Lingpa,

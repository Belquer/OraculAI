when	the	head	is	missing	above	the	neck,	one	should	make	a	number
of	burnt	offerings	using	thorn	bushes,	equalling	the	subject’s	age	in	years,	and
burn	 them	 in	 succession.	 While	 each	 of	 these	 is	 burning,	 the	 heart-mantra
syllable	of	fire	[RAṂ]	
should	be	recited,	for	a	number	of	times	equalling	the
subject’s	age	in	years.
In	cases	when	the	head	and	the	neck	are	missing,	one	should	blacken	one’s
body	with	burnt	charcoal,	and	bind	one’s	hair	up	on	the	crown	of	the	head.	Then,
on	a	piece	of	paper,	four	finger-widths	in	size,	one	should	write	the	subject’s	age
and	the	name	of	the	present	year,	and	around	this	in	the	four	cardinal	directions,

one	 should	 inscribe	 the	 seed-syllables	 of	 the	 four	 elements.	 This	 [paper
simulacrum]	should	then	be	attached	to	the	nose,	and	at	noon	on	the	ninth	day
[of	the	lunar	month],	one	should	run	in	each	of	the	four	directions,	shouting	out
uninterruptedly,	‘You	take	this!	You	take	this!’	Then	the	paper	should	be	buried
in	a	charnel	ground.
In	cases	when	the	upper	trunk	is	missing,	one	should	light	a	wood	fire,	and
burn	a	label	inscribed	with	the	names	of	the	twelve	[animal]	year-signs.	In	cases
when	the	lower	trunk	is	missing,	it	will	suffice	if	one	goes	to	a	charnel	ground,
and	uses	the	assorted	bones	one	finds	to	make	smoke.
In	cases	when	the	right	side	of	the	body	is	missing,	[one	should	recite	the
dhāraṇ
ῑ
	
mantra	of]	Uṣṇ
ῑ
ṣa[-vijayā],	as	many	times	as	equals	the	subject’s	age	in
years,	and	one	should	[mould]	a	number	of	small	terracotta	imprints,	equalling
the	subject’s	age	in	years.	In	cases	when	the	left	side	[of	the	body]	is	missing,
one	should	read	aloud	countless	
dhāraṇ
ῑ
	mantras,	and	wear	red	clothing.
[Ritual	Averting	of	Further	Signs	of	Near	Death]
In	cases	when	the	‘severing	of	the	bond	between	atmosphere	and	earth’	occurs,
one	should	read	aloud	the	extensive	scriptures,
23
	or	complete	a	number	of
virtuous	acts.
In	cases	when	the	‘fall	of	a	rider	on	a	white	lioness’	occurs,	it	will	be
beneficial	if	one	performs	as	many	maṇḍala	rituals	as	equals	the	subject’s	age	in
years.
If	the	‘rupturing	of	the	[Wish-granting]	Tree’	occurs,	one	should	know	the
cures	for	each	of	the	[ailments	affecting]	the	solid	and	hollow	viscera.
24
In	cases	when	urine	scum	appears	reddish	blue,
25
	one	should	fashion	a	dough
effigy	of	the	twelve	[animal]	year-signs,	with	their	elements,
26
	and	for	each
subsequent	change	in	the	colour	[of	the	
urine	scum],	one	should	make	a	single
terracotta	imprint,	a	single	water	libation,	a	single	‘substitute	effigy’	of	the
subject,	and	a	single	burnt	offering	of	birchwood.	Then,	at	sunrise,	one	should
carry	these	off	to	a	cemetery	in	the	north-east.
In	cases	when	[the	urine	vapour]	is	blackish	and	putrid,	one’s	purpose	will	be
achieved	 if	 one	 mixes	 powdered	 iron	 and	 copper	 with	 various	 grains,	 and
scatters	this	[mixture]	in	the	four	directions.
In	cases	when	the	vapour	is	red	and	spotted,	one	should	make	a	number	of

substitutes,	imbued	with	the	subject’s	own	body	odour,	equalling	the	subject’s
age	in	years,	and	attach	a	red	silk	flag	and	a	porcupine	quill	to	each.	[Death]	will
be	averted	if	one	carries	these	off,	together	with	assorted	bones,	to	a	main	road	in
the	east.
In	cases	when	one’s	excrement	has	no	vapour,	one	should	face	the	west	at	a
time	when	the	sun	is	at	its	peak,	and	inscribe	the	elemental	seed-syllables	on	the
skull	of	a	horse.	[Death]	will	then	be	averted	if	one	neighs	as	many	times	as
possible.
In	 cases	 when	 the	 humming	 sound	 [normally	 heard]	 when	 the	 ears	 [are
cupped]	is	absent,
27
	one	should	prepare	a	number	of	torma-offerings	of	various
foods,	equalling	one’s	age	in	years,	and	attach	a	label	to	each	of	these,	bearing
the	names	of	the	twelve	[animal	year-signs].	One’s	purpose	will	be	achieved	if
one	then	conveys	these	[torma-offerings]	to	the	foot	of	a	palm	tree.
28
In	cases	when	the	[sign	known	as]	‘[one-legged	Yavati]	arising	[as	an	enemy]
against	the	leaves	of	the	Wish-granting	Tree’	occurs,	one	will	be	l

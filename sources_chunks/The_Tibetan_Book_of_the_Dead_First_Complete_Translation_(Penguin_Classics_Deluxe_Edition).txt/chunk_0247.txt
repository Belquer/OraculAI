Illusory	Body
	
sgyu-lus
A	 specific	
Vajrayāna
	 concept,	 the	 term	 ‘illusory	 body’	 refers	 to	 a	 unique
embodiment	in	which	an	advanced	
yogin
	arises	at	a	high	level	of	the	
perfection
stage
	according	to	the	
Unsurpassed
	
Yogatantras
.	The	arising	of	the	
yogin
	in	the
form	of	the	illusory	body	occurs	when	an	indivisible	unity	of	buddha-body,
speech	and	mind	has	been	actualised	at	the	conclusion	of	the	
generation
	and
perfection	stages
	of	meditation.	The	attainment	of	the	illusory	body	is	divided

into	two	stages;	the	attainment	of	the	impure	illusory	body	(
ma	dag-pa’i	sgyu-
lus
)	and	then	attainment	of	the	pure	illusory	body	(
dag-pa’i	sgyu-lus
).	The	first
stage	is	called	impure	because	the	
yogin
	is	still	not	totally	free	from	all	
habitual
tendencies
	that	obstruct	subtle	knowledge.	When	the	
yogin
	attains	the	pure
illusory	body,	which	is	in	union	with	inner	radiance,	this	marks	the	attainment	of
the	highest	union	that	is	the	full	awakening	of	
buddhahood
,	the	attainment	of
the	
Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource
.	According	to	the	
perfection	stage
	of
meditation,	there	are	distinctive	meditations	which	focus	on	the	impure	illusory
body	and	the	pure	illusory	body.	In	the	former	case,	the	meditation	focuses	on	all
physical	 phenomena	 as	 being	 dream-like	 and	 illusory	 in	 manner,	 without
inherent	existence
.	In	the	latter	case,	the	meditation	focuses	on	the	
maṇḍala
	of
deities	visualised	according	to	the	so-called	twelve	similes	of	illusion	(
sgyu-ma’i
dpe	bcu-gnyis
).
	
Impermanence
	
mi-rtag-pa
,	Skt
.	anitya
Impermanence,	 along	 with	
suffering
	 and	 the	 absence	 of	
self-identity
,	 is
regarded	in	Buddhism	as	one	of	the	three	marks	or	characteristics	of	causally
conditioned	phenomena.	Although	Buddhist	literature	mentions	various	degrees
of	 impermanence,	 in	 general	 it	 can	 be	 defined	 as	 the	 moment	 by	 moment
changing	nature	of	all	things.	Nothing	endures	through	time	without	change,	and
the	process	of	change	is	dynamic	and	never	ending,	reflecting	the	nature	of	flux
and	fluidity	in	conditioned	existence.	This	fundamental	quality	of	impermanence
extends	to	both	the	e

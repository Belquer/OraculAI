)	of	the	mind,	along	with	
delusion
	and
aversion
.	In	its	extreme	manifestation,	in	the	form	of	insatiable	craving,	it	is	said
to	characterise	the	worlds	of	the	
anguished	spirits

accomplished	masters

	of	time,	during	which	one	thousand	
buddhas

Aversion
	
zhe-sdang
,	Skt.	
dveṣa
One	of	the	‘
three	poisons
’	(
dug-gsum
)	of	the	mind.	In	Buddhist	literature,	the
terms	aversion	and	hatred	are	often	used	interchangeably	with	anger.	In	its	subtle
manifestation	aversion	is	said	to	obstruct	an	individual	from	a	correct	perception
of	forms.	In	its	extreme	manifestation,	as	overwhelming	hatred	and	fear,	it	is	said
to	be	characteristic	of	the	worlds	of	the	
hells
	(
narakaloka
).
	
Awareness
	
rig-pa
,	Skt.	
vidyā
As	an	ordinary	verb,	the	Tibetan	term	
rig-pa
	means	‘to	know’	or	‘to	be	aware’.
When	used	as	a	noun,	it	has	several	distinct	though	not	unrelated	meanings,
corresponding	to	the	Sanskrit	
vidyā
:	1)	as	a	general	term	encompassing	all
experiences	of	
consciousness
	and	mental	events,	2)	as	intelligence	or	mental
aptitude,	3)	as	a	science	or	knowledge-based	discipline,	4)	as	a	pure	awareness.
Our	text	generally	assumes	the	last	of	these	meanings,	in	which	cases	it	is	a
synonym	 or	 abbreviation	 for	
intrinsic	 awareness
	 (
rang-rig
).	 See	 under

Awareness	Holder
	
rig-’dzin
,	Skt
.	vidyādhara
The	awareness	holders	or	knowledge	holders	are	embodiments	of	the	great
accomplished	 masters
	 who	 have	 attained	 the	 highest	
realisations
	 of	 the
tantras
.	Amongst	those	whose	accomplishments	are	classified	as	supramundane
are	
Padmasambhava
	
and	
Vimalamitra
,	who	have	transcended	the	span	of	human
life,	having	attained	the	
rainbow	body
	 through	 the	 practices	 of	 the	
Great
Perfection
.	Five	kinds	of	awareness	holder	are	particularly	identified,	and	their
realisations	are	said	to	parallel	those	of	the	
bodhisattva
	and	
buddha
	levels,
namely	the	awareness	holders	of	maturation,	those	with	power	over	the	lifespan,
those	abiding	on	the	levels,	those	of	the	Great	Seal,	and	those	of	spontaneous
presence.

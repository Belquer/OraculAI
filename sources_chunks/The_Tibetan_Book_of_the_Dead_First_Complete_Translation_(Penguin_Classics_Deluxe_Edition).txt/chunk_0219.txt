the
five	psycho-physical	aggregates	(
pañcaskandha
).	These	are:	the	
aggregate	of
form
	(
rūpaskandha
),	the	
aggregate	of	feelings
	(
vedanāskandha
),	the	
aggregate
of	perceptions
	(
saṃjñāskandha
	
),	the	
aggregate	of	motivational	tendencies
(
saṃskāraskandha
),	and	the	
aggregate	of	consciousness
	(
vijñānaskandha
).	The

Tibetan	term	
phung-po
,	like	its	Sanskrit	counterpart,	literally	means	a	‘heap’	or	a
‘pile’,	an	aggregate	of	many	parts.	
Sentient	beings
	in	the	
desire
	and	
form
realms
	manifestly	possess	all	the	five	aggregates	and	those	in	the	
formless
realm
	only	the	four	mental	aggregates.
	
Aggregate	 of	 Consciousness
	
rnam-par	 shes-pa’i	 phung-po
,	 Skt.
vijñānaskandha
In	the	context	of	our	text	the	aggregate	of	
consciousness
	comprises	the	so-called
‘
eight	classes	of	consciousness
’	(
rnam-shes	tshogs-brgyad
).	These	are:	1)	the
ground-of-all	 consciousness
	 (
kun-gzhi	 rnam-par	 shes-pa
),	 which	 is	 an
undifferentiated	foundational	consciousness	underlying	all	the	other	aspects	of
consciousness	in	which	are	stored	the	imprints	left	by	past	experiences;	2)	the
deluded	consciousness	(
nyonmong	yid-kyi	rnam-par	shes-pa
),	which	is	pervaded
by	fundamental	ignorance	and	is	responsible	for	our	sense	of	selfhood	and
dualistic	 misapprehension	 of	 the	 true	 nature	 of	 phenomena;	 3)	 the	 mental
consciousness	(
yid-kyi	rnam-par	shes-pa
),	which	objectively	refers	to	mental
constructs,	thoughts	and	the	experience	of	our	senses;	4)	visual	consciousness
(
mig-gi	rnam-par	shes-pa
);	5)	auditory	consciousness	(
rna’i	rnam-par	shes-pa
);
6)	olfactory	consciousness	(
sna’i	rnam-par	shes-pa
);	7)	gustatory	consciousness
(
lce’i	rnam-par	shes-pa
);	and	8)	tactile	consciousness	(
luskyi	rnam-par	shes-pa
).
	
Aggregate	of	Feelings
	
tshor-ba’i	phung-po
,	Skt.	
vedanāskandha
The	aggregate	of	feelings	encompasses	the	pleasant,	unpleasant,	and	neutral
sensations	which	arise	as	an	immediate	reaction	to	objects	of	our	senses.
	
Aggregate	of	Form
	
gzugs-kyi	phung-po
,	Skt.	
rūpaskandha
The	aggregate	of	form	includes	both	the	subtle	and	manifest	forms	derived	from
the	
elements
	and	experienced	through	the	five	senses,	including,	of	course,	our
bodies	and	the	environment.	The	aggregate	of	form	is	considered	to	have	fifteen
aspects,	namely	those	related	to	the	
elements
,	earth,	water,	fire	and	wind;	those
related	 to	 the	 five	 sense	 objects,	 visual	 forms,	 sounds,	 smells,	 tastes,	 and
contacts;	those	related	to	the	five	sense-organs,	eye,	ear,	nose,	tongue,	and	body,
and,	lastly,	that	aspect	related	to	imperceptible	forms	which	are	said	to	be
continuously	present	throughout	past,	present	and	future	time.
	
Aggregate	 of	 Motivational	 Tendencies
	
‘du-byas-kyi	 phung-po
,	 Skt.
saṃskāraskandha

The	aggregate	of	motivational	tendencies,	sometimes	translated	also	as	‘mental
formations’,	refers	to	the	array	of	specific	types	of	causative	mental	states	which
give	rise	to	our	characteristic	perspectives	and	emotions	and	which	in	turn
condition	our	actions.	These	are	the	motivating	impulses	behind	our	thoughts,
speech	and	actions	which	relate	in	specific	ways	to	the	perceived	object.	This
aggregate	includes	the	numerous	modalities	of	the	mind,	such	as	the	fifty-one
mental	 factors
	 listed	 in	 the	
abhidharma
	 texts,	 as	 well	 as	 our	 habits,
dispositions,	and	conceptualisation	tendencies.
	
Aggregate	of	Perceptions
	
‘du-shes-kyi	phung-po
,	Skt.	
saṃjñāskandha
The	aggregate	of	perceptions	recognises	and	identifies	forms	and	objects.	It
differentiates	 one	 form/object	 from	 another	 and	 names	 them.	 This	 process
includes	extensive,	minute,	and	mediocre	modes	of	objectifying	perception.

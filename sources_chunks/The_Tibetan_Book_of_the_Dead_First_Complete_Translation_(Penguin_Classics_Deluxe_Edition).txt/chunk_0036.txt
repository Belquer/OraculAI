medium’.
[Fourth],	the	great	medium	of	errorless	result
Is	this	radiant	immediate	awareness	—
Since	it	is	radiant	and	without	error,	it	is	called	a	‘medium’.
	
[Now]	the	four	great	nails,	which	are	unchanging,	are	presented:
15
[First],	the	great	nail	of	the	unchanging	view
Is	this	radiant	immediate	awareness	—
Since	it	is	firm	throughout	the	three	times,	it	is	called	a	‘nail’.	[Second],	the
great	nail	of	unchanging	meditation
Is	this	radiant	immediate	awareness	—
Since	it	is	firm	throughout	the	three	times,	it	is	called	a	‘nail’.
[Third],	the	great	nail	of	unchanging	conduct
Is	this	radiant	immediate	awareness	—
Since	it	is	firm	throughout	the	three	times,	it	is	called	a	‘nail’.
[Fourth],	the	great	nail	of	the	unchanging	result

Is	this	radiant	immediate	awareness	—
Since	it	is	firm	throughout	the	three	times,	it	is	called	a	‘nail’.
	
Now	follows	the	esoteric	instruction	which	reveals	the	three	times	to	be	one:
Abandon	your	notions	of	the	past,	without	attributing	a	temporal	sequence!
Cut	off	your	mental	associations	regarding	the	future,	without	anticipation!
Rest	in	a	spacious	modality,	without	clinging	to	[the	thoughts	of]	the	present.
Do	not	meditate	at	all,	since	there	is	nothing	upon	which	to	meditate.
Instead,	revelation	will	come	through	undistracted	mindfulness	—
Since	there	is	nothing	by	which	you	can	be	distracted.
Nakedly	observe	[all	that	arises]	in	this	modality,	which	is	without	meditation
and	without	distraction!
When	this	[experience]	arises,
Intrinsically	aware,	naturally	cognisant,	naturally	radiant	and	clear,
It	is	called	‘the	mind	of	enlightenment’.
Since	[within	this	mind	of	enlightenment]	there	is	nothing	upon	which	to
meditate,
This	[modality]	transcends	all	objects	of	knowledge.
Since	[within	this	mind	of	enlightenment]	there	are	no	distractions,
It	is	the	radiance	of	the	essence	itself.
This	Buddha-body	of	Reality,	[union	of]	radiance	and	emptiness,
In	which	[the	duality	of]	appearance	and	emptiness	is	naturally	liberated,
Becomes	 manifest	 [in	 this	 way],	 unattained	 by	 the	 [structured]	 path	 to
buddhahood,
And	thus	Vajrasattva	is	[actually]	perceived	at	this	moment.
	
Now	follows	the	instruction	which	brings	one	to	the	point	where	the	six
extreme	[perspectives]	are	exhausted:
16
Though	there	is	a	vast	plethora	of	discordant	views,
Within	this	intrinsic	awareness	or	[single	nature	of]	mind,
Which	is	the	naturally	originating	pristine	cognition,
There	is	no	duality	between	the	object	viewed	and	the	observer.
Without	focusing	on	the	view,	search	for	the	observer!
Though	one	searches	for	this	observer,	none	will	be	found.
So,	at	that	instant,	one	will	be	brought	to	the	exhaustion	point	of	the	view.
At	that	very	moment,	one	will	encounter	the	innermost	boundary	of	the	view.

Since	there	is	no	object	at	all	to	be	observed,
And	since	one	has	not	fallen	into	a	primordial	vacuous	emptiness,
17
The	lucid	awareness,	which	is	now	present,
Is	itself	the	view	of	the	Great	Perfection.
[Here],	there	is	no	duality	between	realisation	and	lack	of	realisation.
Though	there	is	a	vast	plethora	of	discordant	meditations,
Within	this	intrinsic	awareness,
Which	penetrates	ordinary	consciousness	to	the	core,
There	is	no	duality	between	the	object	of	meditation	and	the	meditator.
Without	meditating	on	the	object	of	meditation,	search	for	the	meditator!
Though	one	searches	for	this	meditator,	none	will	be	found.
So,	at	that	instant,	one	will	be	brought	to	the	exhaustion	point	of	meditation.
At	 that	 very	 moment,	 one	 will	 encounter	 the	 innermost	 boundary	 of
meditation.
Since	there	is	no	object	at	all	on	which	to	meditate,
And	since	one	has	not	fallen	under	the	sway	of	delusion,	drowsiness,	or
agitation,
18
The	lucid	uncontrived	awareness,	which	is	now	present,
Is	itself	the	uncontrived	meditative	equipoise	or	concentration.
[Here],	there	is	no	duality	between	abiding	and	non-abiding.
	
Though	there	is	a	vast	plethora	of	discordant	modes	of	conduct,
Within	this	intrinsic	awareness,
Which	is	the	unique	seminal	po

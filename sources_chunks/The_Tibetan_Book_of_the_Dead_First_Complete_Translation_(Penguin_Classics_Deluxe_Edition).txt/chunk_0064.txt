OṂ	 Since	 our	 minds	 are	 not	 endowed	 with	 pristine	 cognition,	 which	 is
intrinsic	awareness,
We	have	not	correctly	integrated	the	psycho-physical	aggregates,	the	sensory
spectra,	and	their	activity	fields,
Within	the	maṇḍala	of	the	peaceful	deities.
We	seek	the	forgiveness	of	each	of	you,	the	forty-two	peaceful	deities!
	
Since	our	minds	are	not	endowed	with	pristine	cognition,	which	is	intrinsic
awareness,
We	have	not	correctly	integrated	the	five	psycho-physical	aggregates	with	the
five	[male	buddhas]	of	the	enlightened	families,
And	further	still,	our	own	minds,	swayed	by	ignorance,	have	continued	to	be

afflicted	by	egotism.
We	seek	the	forgiveness	of	you,	the	assembly	of	Samantabhadra!

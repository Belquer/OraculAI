one’s	own
mind,
Do	arise	as	discernible	manifestations,
Buddhahood	is	present	[simply]	when	they	are	not	subjectively	apprehended
or	grasped.
Bewilderment	does	not	come	about	on	account	of	these	appearances	—
But	it	does	come	about	through	their	subjective	apprehension.
[Thus],	if	the	subjectively	apprehending	thoughts	are	known	to	be	[of	the
single	nature	of]	mind,	they	will	be	liberated	of	their	own	accord.
	
All	things	that	appear	are	manifestations	of	mind.
The	surrounding	environment	which	appears	to	be	inanimate,	that	too	is	mind.
The	sentient	life-forms	which	appear	as	the	six	classes	of	living	beings,	they
too	are	mind.
The	joys	of	both	the	gods	and	humans	of	the	higher	existences	which	appear,
they	too	are	mind.
The	sorrows	of	the	three	lower	existences	which	appear,	they	too	are	mind.

The	five	poisons,	representing	the	dissonant	mental	states	of	ignorance,	which
appear,	they	too	are	mind.
The	awareness,	that	is	self-originating	pristine	cognition	which	appears,	it	too
is	mind.
The	beneficial	thoughts	conducive	to	attainment	of	nirvāṇa	which	appear,	they
too	are	mind.
The	obstacles	of	malevolent	forces	and	spirits	which	appear,	they	too	are
mind.
The	deities	and	[spiritual]	accomplishments	which	manifest	exquisitely,	they
too	are	mind.
The	diverse	kinds	of	pure	[vision]	which	appear,	they	too	are	mind.
The	non-conceptual	one-pointed	abiding	[in	meditation]	which	appears,	it	too
is	mind.
The	colours	characteristic	of	objects	which	appear,	they	too	are	mind.
The	state	without	characteristics	and	without	conceptual	elaboration	which
appears,	it	too	is	mind.
The	non-duality	of	the	single	and	the	multiple	which	appears,	it	too	is	mind.
The	unproveability	of	existence	and	non-existence	which	appears,	it	too	is
mind.

There	are	no	appearances	at	all	apart	from	[those	that	originate	in]	the	mind.
The	unimpeded	nature	of	mind	assumes	all	manner	of	appearances.
Yet,	though	these	[appearances]	arise,	they	are	without	duality,
And	they	[naturally]	subside	into	the	modality	of	mind,
Like	waves	in	the	waters	of	an	ocean.
Whatever	 names	 are	 given	 to	 these	 unceasingly	 [arising]	 objects	 of
designation,
In	actuality,	there	is	but	one	[single	nature	of]	mind,
And	that	single	[nature	of	mind]	is	without	foundation	and	without	root.
[Therefore],	it	is	not	perceptible	at	all,	in	any	direction	whatsoever.
It	is	not	perceptible	as	substance,	for	it	lacks	inherent	existence	in	all	respects.
It	is	not	perceptible	as	emptiness,	for	it	is	the	resonance	of	awareness	and
radiance.
It	is	not	perceptible	as	diversity,	for	it	is	the	indivisibility	of	radiance	and
emptiness.
This	present	intrinsic	awareness	is	manifestly	radiant	and	clear,
And	even	though	there	exists	no	known	means	by	which	it	can	be	fabricated,

And	even	though	[this	awareness]	is	without	inherent	existence,
It	can	be	directly	experienced.
[Thus],	if	it	is	experientially	cultivated,	all	[beings]	will	be	liberated.
[CONCLUSION]
All	those	of	all	[differing]	potential,	regardless	of	their	acumen	or	dullness,
May	realise	[this	intrinsic	awareness].
However,	for	example,	even	though	sesame	is	the	source	of	oil,	and	milk	of
butter,
But	there	will	be	no	extract	if	these	are	unpressed	or	unchurned,
Similarly,	even	though	all	beings	actually	possess	the	seed	of	buddhahood,
Sentient	beings	will	not	attain	buddhahood	without	experiential	cultivation.
Nonetheless,	even	a	cowherd	will	attain	liberation	if	he	or	she	engages	in
experiential	cultivation.
For,	even	though	one	may	not	know	how	to	elucidate	[this	state]	intellectually,
One	will	[through	experiential	cultivation]	become	manifestly	established	in
it.
One	whose	mouth	has	actually	tasted	molasses,
Does	not	need	others	to	explain	its	taste.
But,	even	learned	scholars	who	have	not	realised	[this	single	nature	of	mind]
will	remain	the	victims	of	bewilderment.
For,	however	learned	and	knowledgeable	in	explaining	the	nine	vehicles	they
may	be,
They	will	be	like	those	who	spread	fabulous	tales	of	remote	[places]	they	have
never	se

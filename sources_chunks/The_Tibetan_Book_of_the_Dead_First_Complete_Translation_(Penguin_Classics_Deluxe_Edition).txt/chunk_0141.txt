your	 behalf,	 you	 may
perceive,	with	your	present	subtle	cognitive	ability,	that	these	[rites]	are	being
performed	impurely	and	distractedly,	
and	that	those	[who	are	performing	these
rituals]	are	impure	in	both	their	commitments	and	vows	and	are	careless	in	their
conduct.	As	a	result,	you	may	have	no	confidence	in	them,	you	may	form	a	bad
opinion	of	them,	and	you	may	become	fearfully	and	horribly	aware	of	their
negative	past	actions,	etc.,	as	well	as	of	their	impure	practice	of	the	[sacred]
teachings	and	the	rituals.	Feeling	this,	you	will	experience	the	utmost	sadness,
and	think:	‘Alas,	they	have	betrayed	me!	They	have	truly	betrayed	me!’	As	a
consequence	of	your	profound	disenchantment,	instead	of	maintaining	purity	of
perception	and	[feelings	of]	respect,	negative	opinions	and	loss	of	confidence
will	 arise	 within	 you.	 Thus,	 [these	 perceptions	 and	 feelings]	 will	 form	 a
connecting	link	that	will	certainly	propel	you	into	the	lower	existences,	and,	in
this	way,	[your	subtle	cognitive	ability	and	the	rituals	recited	on	your	behalf]
will	not	have	been	of	benefit,	but	rather	of	great	harm.
However	impure	may	be	the	practice	of	the	[sacred]	teachings	by	your	friends
now	left	behind,	you	must	maintain	respect	and	purity	of	perception	from	the
depths	of	your	heart.	Think	to	yourself:	‘My	own	perception	is	so	polluted!	How
could	the	speech	of	the	buddhas	be	impure!	These	[impure	perspectives]	have
arisen	as	a	consequence	of	my	own	impure	perception,	and	[will	appear	to	me]
just	as	the	flaws	on	my	face	will	be	reflected	in	a	mirror.	As	for	these	[individuals
performing	the	rituals,	in	reality]	their	bodies	are	the	[sublime]	community	of
monks	and	nuns,	their	speech	is	the	genuine	[sacred]	teaching,	and	their	minds
are	the	essence	of	the	buddhas.	Therefore,	I	take	refuge	in	them.’	Thinking	thus,
whatever	 activities	 occur	 in	 the	 place	 that	 you	 have	 left	 behind,	 they	 will

certainly	be	beneficial	to	you.	It	is	extremely	important	to	maintain	this	purity	of
perception.	Do	not	forget	this!
Even	if	you	are	about	to	be	born	into	the	lower	existences,	[yet	you	do
maintain	purity	of	perception],	and	you	perceive	the	relatives	that	you	have	left
behind	practising	the	virtuous	teachings,	unstained	by	negativity,	and	you	see
your	spiritual	teachers	and	masters	purely	practising	the	rituals	with	virtuous
body,	speech	and	mind,	you	will	feel	great	joy.	Simply	through	this	[experience
of	great	joy],	even	though	you	were	about	to	fall	into	lower	existences,	this	[joy]
will	form	a	connecting	link,	which	will	certainly	turn	you	back	towards	the
higher	realms.	Since	there	is	such	manifold	benefit,	do	not	now	lapse	into	impure
perception.	It	is	
extremely	important	to	maintain	purity	of	perception	and	to	be
unbiasedly	devoted.	So,	be	careful!
O,	 Child	 of	 Buddha	 Nature,	 in	 short,	 since	 your	 awareness	 during	 this
intermediate	state	lacks	any	[material]	support,	it	is	light	and	volatile,	and
therefore,	whatever	virtuous	or	non-virtuous	perceptions	arise,	these	are	very
powerful.	 Do	 not	 be	 absorbed	 by	 non-virtuous	 thoughts!	 Call	 to	 mind	 the
virtuous	practices	of	your	past!	Even	if	you	did	not	engage	in	virtuous	practices
[during	your	life],	maintain	purity	of	perception	and	deep	devotion!	Pray	to	your
meditational	deity	or	to	Mahākaruṇika,	and	with	a	powerful	longing	repeat	the
following	aspirational	prayer:
20
	
Now	when	I	roam	alone,	separated	from	loved	ones,
And	[myriad]	images	of	emptiness	arise,	naturally	manifesting,
May	the	buddhas	[quickly]	release	the	power	of	their	compassion,
And	 may	 the	 fear	 of	 the	 awesome	 and	 terrifying	 intermediate	 state	 be
annulled.
	
When	I	experience	suffering,	as	the	result	of	negative	past	actions,
May	the	meditational	deity	[Mahākāruṇika]	dispel	all	such	misery,
And	as	the	natural	sound	of	reality	reverberates	like	a	thousand	peals	of
thunder,
May	all	sounds	be	transformed	into	the	resonance	of	the	Six	Syllables.
	
When	I	am	driven	on	by	past	actions,	unable	to	f

Since	our	minds	are	not	endowed	with	pristine	cognition,	which	is	intrinsic
awareness,
We	have	been	afflicted	by	bewildering	ignorance,
And	have	been	alienated	from	the	meditational	deities
By	the	force	of	dissonant	mental	states	and	past	[negative]	actions.
Swayed	by	self-deception,	we	have	disappointed	our	teachers,
Stirred	by	strong	pride,	we	have	agitated	our	spiritual	brothers	and	sisters,
Distracted	by	vanity,
6
	we	have	divulged	the	secret	mantras,
Gripped	by	miserliness,	we	have	been	untimely	in	the	dedication	of	offerings,
Entrapped	by	base	friendships,	we	have	violated	the	secret	[precepts]	of	the
rituals,
Weakened	by	feeble	yogic	discipline,	we	have	failed	to	eradicate	obstructing
forces.
Thus,	 [our	 commitments]	 have	 degenerated	 due	 to	 either	 excessive	 or

deficient	determination	and	strength.
	
Throughout	our	lives,	from	beginningless	time	until	the	present	[life],
In	which	we	have	assumed	this	body,
However	much	negativity	and	non-virtuous	past	actions	we	have	accrued,
We	seek	your	forgiveness	for	all	these	transgressions.
	
O	you	whose	cognisance	and	knowledge	spans	[the	three]	times,
Since	you	are	sublime	beings,	embrace	us!
Since	we	are	sentient	beings,	we	are	flawed	and	bewildered,
And,	since	[this	separation]	is

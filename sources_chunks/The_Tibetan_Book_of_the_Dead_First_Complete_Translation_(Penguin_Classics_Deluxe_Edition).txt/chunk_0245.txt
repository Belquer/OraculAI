Greater	Vehicle
	
theg-pa	chen-po

When	the	Buddhist	teachings	are	classified	according	to	their	power	to	lead
beings	to	an	enlightened	state,	a	distinction	is	made	between	the	teachings	of	the
Lesser	 Vehicle
	 (
h
ῑ
nayāna
)	 and	 those	 of	 the	 Greater	 Vehicle.	 In	 terms	 of
motivation,	the	practitioner	of	the	Lesser	Vehicle	emphasises	the	individual’s
own	freedom	from	
cyclic	existence
	as	the	primary	motivation	and	goal	and	the
practitioner	of	the	Greater	Vehicle	emphasises	altruism	and	has	the	
liberation
	of
all	
sentient	beings
	as	the	principal	objective.	As	the	term	‘Greater	Vehicle’
implies,	the	path	followed	by	
bodhisattvas
	is	analogous	to	a	large	carriage	which
can	transport	a	vast	number	of	people	to	
liberation
,	as	compared	to	a	smaller
vehicle	for	the	individual	practitioner.	In	terms	of	philosophy,	the	principal
philosophical	schools	of	the	Lesser	Vehicle	are	
Vaibhāṣika
	and	
Sautrāntika
	and
those	of	the	Greater	Vehicle	are	
Cittamātra
	and	
Madhyamaka
.	In	terms	of	the
path,	the	Lesser	Vehicle	emphasises	complete	renunciation	of	
dissonant	mental
states
	 and	 the	 practice	 of	 the	
four	 nble	 truths
	 and	 the	
twelve	 links	 of
dependent	origination
,	while	the	Greater	Vehicle	allows	the	taking	on	to	the
path	 of	
dissonant	 mental	 states
	 and	 emphasises	 the	 practice	 of	 the	
six
perfections
.	 According	 to	 the	 Greater	 Vehicle,	 the	 entire	 path	 towards	 the

attainment	of	
buddhahood
	is	presented	within	the	framework	of	two	main
systems	or	
vehicles
	
(
yāna
),	those	of	the	
sūtras
	(
sūtrayāna
)	and	the	
tantras
(
tantrayāna
).	 The	 former,	 also	 known	 as	 the	
vehicle
	 of	
bodhisattvas
(
bodhisattvayāna
),	 entails	 a	 progression	 from	
fundamental	 ignorance
	 to
enlightenement
	 which	 may	 take	 place	 over	 an	 immeasurable	 number	 of
lifetimes.	 The	 latter,	 also	 known	 as	 the	
Vehicle	 of	 Indestructible	 Reality
(
Vajrayāna
)	or	the	
vehicle
	of	
secret
	
mantras
	(
guhyamantrayāna
),	includes	the
preliminary	practices
	and	the	
generation
	and	
perfection	stages
	of	meditation
through	which	it	is	said	that	enlightenment	can	be	achieved	in	a	single	lifetime.

Habitual	Tendencies

The	deep-seated	propensities	and	habitual	tendencies	inherited	from	our	
past
actions
.	 This	 concept	 of	 habitual	 tendencies	 is	 critical	 to	 the	 Buddhist
understanding	 of	 the	 causal	 dynamics	 of	 karmic	 actions	 as	 well	 as	 its
understanding	 of	 the	 process	 of	 conditioning.	 For	 example,	 when	 a	 person

commits	an	act,	such	as	the

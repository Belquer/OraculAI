The	 four	
empowerments
	 of	 the	
Unsurpassed
	
Yoga	 tantras
,	 including
Mahāyoga
,	 are:	 the	 vase	 empowerment	 (
bum-dbang
),	 which	 purifies	 the
ordinary	body	and	its	
energy	channels
	into	the	
Buddha-body	of	Emanation
(
nirmāṇakāya
);	the	secret	empowerment	(
gsang-dbang
),	which	purifies	ordinary
speech	 and	 its	
vital	 energy
	
into	 the	
Buddha-body	 of	 Perfect	 Resource
(
sambhogakāya
);	the	empowerment	of	discriminative	
pristine	cognition
	(
shes-
rab	ye-shes-kyi	dbang
)	which	purifies	ordinary	mind	and	its	
seminal	point
(
bindu
)	into	the	
Buddha-body	of	Reality
	(
dharmakāya
	
);	and	the	empowerment
of	word	and	meaning	(
tshig-don-gi	dbang
),	which	purifies	these	three	equally
into	 the	 Buddha-body	 of	 Essentiality	 (
svabhāvikakāya

The	four	formless	meditative	absorptions	which	lead	to	birth	in
the	world-system	of	formlessness,	at	the	summit	of	
cyclic	existence
,	are	those
known	 as:	 infinite	 as	 the	 sky	 (
ākāśānantyāyatana
),	 infinite	 consciousness
(
vijñānānantyāyatana
),	nothing-at-all	(

compassion

equanimity
.	 The

cultivation	of	the	four	immeasurable	wishes,	which	is	normally	accompanied	by
the	recitation	of	a	short	prayer	(see	Chapter	1),	is	a	common	preliminary	to	daily
practice.	This	contemplation	establishes	correct	motivation	and	provides	a	strong
impetus	to	the	cultivation	of	the	
altruistic	intention	to	attain	enlightenment
for	the	sake	of	all	sentient	beings.

Four	Modes	of	Liberation
	
grol-lugs	bzhi
The	 four	 modes	 of	 liberation,	 according	 to	 Atiyoga,	 comprise:	 primordial
liberation	(
ye-grol
	),	
natural	liberation
	(
rang-grol
	),	direct	liberation	(
cer-grol
	),
and	 further	 liberation	 (
yang-grol
)	 or	 liberation	 from	 extremes	 (
mtha’-grol
).
These	are	attained	in	connection	with	the	
intermediate	state	of	meditative
concentration
	(

Four	Noble	Truths
	
bden-pa	bzhi
,	Skt.	
caturāryasatya
The	teaching	on	the	four	noble	truths	forms	the	basis	of	the	first	promulgation	of
Buddhism,	since	it	is	the	very	first	formal	discourse	given	by	
Śākyamuni
	in
Sarnath
	
following	his	attainment	of	
buddhahood
	at	
Bodh	Gaya
.	The	four	truths
are:	the	truth	of	
suffering
,	the	truth	of	its	origins,	the	truth	of	its	cessation,	and
the	truth	of	the	path	leading	to	such	cessation.	The	doctrine	of	four	truths	lays
the	foundation	upon	which	the	entire	structure	of	the	path	to	
buddhahood
	is
built	and	the	understanding	of	these	four	truths	is	therefore	an	indispensable
basis	 for	 a	 successful	 practice	 of	 the	 Buddhist	 path.	 The	 first	 two	 truths
constitute	one	inter-relationship	of	
cause	and	effect
	and	the	remaining	two,
another.	 Without	 proper	 insight	 into	 the	 first	 inter-relationship	 no	 genuine
aspiration	to	seek	freedom	from	
cyclic	existence
	
will	arise.	Similarly,	without
insight	into	the	second,	no	genuine	release	from	the	bondage	of	
karmically
conditioned	existence	can	be	achieved.

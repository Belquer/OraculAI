Past	Actions
	
las
,	Skt.	
karma
The	technical	term	‘
karma
’	refers	to	the	dynamic	relationship	between	actions
and	their	consequences.	It	includes	in	its	causal	aspect	both	the	actual	actions
(physical,	verbal	and	mental)	and	the	psychological	imprints	and	tendencies
created	within	the	mind	by	such	actions.	After	the	performance	of	an	action	a
causal	chain	is	maintained	within	the	mental	continuum	which	continues	through
the	present	and	successive	rebirths.	Such	a	karmic	potential	is	activated	when	it
interacts	with	appropriate	circumstances	and	conditions,	thus	leading	to	the
fruition	of	its	effects.	This	dynamic	of	past	actions	has	two	main	features:	1)	one
never	experiences	the	consequences	of	an	action	not	committed;	and	2)	the
potential	of	an	action	once	committed	is	never	lost	unless	obviated	by	specific
remedies.	It	is	also	worth	bearing	in	mind	that	the	idea	of	‘past	actions’	in
Buddhism	cannot	be	equated	with	the	notion	of	causality	as	understood	in	a
strictly	deterministic	sense.

Penetrative	Insight
	
lhag-mthong
,	Skt.	
vipaśyanā
This	is	an	analytical	meditative	state,	penetrating	the	nature,	characteristics	or
function	of	the	chosen	object	of	
meditation
,	which	is	accompanied	by	physical
and	mental	suppleness	and	generated	on	the	basis	of	mental	tranquillity	or	
calm
abiding
.	The	object	of	such	an	insight	can	be	mundane,	such	as	the	topics	of
impermanence
	
and	
suffering
,	 or	 supramundane,	 such	 as	
emptiness
,	 the
ultimate	nature	of	
reality
.	This	‘penetrative	insight’	can	be	attained	only	in	union
with	
calm	abiding
,	and	many	
meditation
	manuals	state	that	the	
realisation
	of
‘calm	
abiding
’	is	an	essential	prerequisite	for	the	cultivation	of	‘penetrative
insight’.	However,	in	
Unsurpassed
	
Yogatantra
	there	exist	advanced	techniques
which	enable	practitioners	to	attain	‘
calm	abiding
’	and	‘penetrative	insight’
simultaneously.

Perfection	of	Discriminative	Awareness
	
sher-phyin
,	Skt.	
prajñāpāramitā
Often	 translated	 also	 as	 ‘perfection	 of	 wisdom’,	 the	 Sanskrit	 word
prajñāpāramitā
	
refers	to	the	sixth	of	the	
six	perfections
	(Skt.	
s
aṭpāramitā
)
which	are	cultivated	by	
bodhisattvas
.	The	term	‘perfection	of	discriminative
awareness’	has	three	different	applications:	firstly,	it	may	refer	to	the	resultant,
perfected	discriminative	awareness	(’
bras-bu	sher-phyin
)	of	a	
buddha
,	which	is
totally	non-dual,	free	of	all	
obscurations
,	and	perceives	spontaneously	in	a
single	mental	act	the	dual	aspects	of	all	phenomena.	See	
Two	Truths
.	Secondly,
it	may	refer	to	the	
bodhisattva	paths
	which	lead	to	the	above	perfection	of
discriminative	 awareness	 (
lam	 sher-phyin
),	 blending	 together	 at	 the	 most
profound	level	the	discriminative	awareness	of	
emptiness
	(
śūnyatā
)	and	the
skiful	means
	of	great	
compassion
	(
mahākaruṇā
).	Thirdly,	it	may	denote	the
literature	 of	 the	
Prajñāpāramitā
	 subdivision	 of	 the	
sūtras
	 of	 the	
Greater
Vehicle
,	which	outline	the	essential	aspects	of	those	paths	and	results	(
gzhung
sher-phyin
).	 Iconographically,	
Prajñāpāramitā
	 is	 depicted	 in	 the	 form	 of	 a
female	
meditational	deity
	and	the	Sanskrit	
sūtras
	themselves	are	invariably
entitled	
Transcendent	Lady	who	is	the	Perfection	of	Discriminative	Awareness
(
Bhagavat
ῑ
prajñāpāramitā
).	See	also	under

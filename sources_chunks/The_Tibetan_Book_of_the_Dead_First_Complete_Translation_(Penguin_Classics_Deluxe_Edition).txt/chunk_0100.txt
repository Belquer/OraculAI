ds.	Immediately,	the	rectum	should	be	closed	and	drawn	in,	so	that

there	is	no	option	but	for	the	seminal	point	to	
be	forced	upwards	by	the	power	of
the	vital	energy	below.	Then,	by	means	of	HI-KA	HI-KA	gasps,	which	should	be
performed	to	the	best	of	one’s	ability,	[the	seminal	point]	should	be	moved
upwards,	and,	as	it	reaches	the	orifice	of	the	left	nostril,	the	[motion	of	one’s]
awareness	should	be	synchronised	with	[that	of	one’s]	respiration.	Then,	in	an
instant,	like	an	arrow	being	fired,	[one’s	awareness]	should	penetrate	the	heart	of
the	Buddha-body	of	Emanation	which	is	before	one.	Let	the	vital	energy	and
awareness	 remain	 there,	 without	 reabsorbing	 them	 [into	 one’s	 body].	 This
exercise	should	be	repeated	until	one’s	consciousness	does	depart	[the	body].
Consequently,	[the	transference]	is	certain	to	take	effect.	Once	consciousness
does	depart	in	that	state,	it	is	certain	that	one	will	subsequently	take	birth	in	an
emanational	body	which	will	act	for	the	benefit	of	sentient	beings.
If	the	consciousness	transference	into	the	Buddha-body	of	Emanation	does
occur	in	the	above	way,	as	an	‘outer	sign’,	clouds	or	rainbows	will	appear	in	the
sky,	some	resembling	a	wish-granting	tree	or	unfurled	white	silk,	or	a	shower	of
flowers,	and	so	forth.	As	an	‘inner	sign’,	blood,	serous	fluid,	or	generative	fluid
will	emerge	from	the	left	nostril;	or	else	dew-like	drops,	and	so	forth	may
appear.	 The	 ‘secret	 signs’	 include	 the	 appearance	 of	 many	 small	 relics,	 a
complete	unbroken	skull,	and	[bones	in	the	shape	of]	the	hand-emblems	of
deities.

Such	is	the	consciousness	transference	into	the	Buddha-body	of	Emanation.

Instantaneous	Consciousness	Transference
All	the	[above	methods	of	consciousness	transference	are	appropriate]	in	the
context	of	a	person	whose	death	is	gradual;	but	in	the	case	of	those	who	die
suddenly,	there	will	not	be	sufficient	time	to	engage	in	meditations,	such	as	those
[just	 described].	 In	 this	 case,	 therefore,	 the	 method	 of	 instantaneous
consciousness	transference	becomes	most	important.	Since	it	is	unknown	what
the	circumstances	of	one’s	death	will	be,	one	should,	from	this	very	moment,
alternate	 one’s	 training,	 sometimes	 practising	 the	 consciousness-transference
technique	of	the	training	phase,	[described	earlier],	and	sometimes	practising	the
instantaneous	consciousness	transference.
The	[practice]	should	be	undertaken	in	the	following	manner:	
One	should
establish	a	clear	and	mindful	resolution,	thinking,	‘If	I	die	suddenly,	my	mental

focus	should	be	directed	towards	the	crown	of	my	head!’	This	resolution	is
extremely	important.	It	is	similar,	for	example,	to	the	resolution	of	someone	who
thinks	that	one	should	get	up	and	leave	[home]	when	the	moon	rises	on	the
twenty-second	day	[of	the	lunar	month].	If	[this	mental	focus]	is	continuously
maintained	during	the	evening	of	the	[day	before],	one	will	[actually]	awaken
when	the	moon	rises,	just	after	midnight.	In	exactly	this	way,	from	this	very
moment	onwards,	one	should	practise	projecting	one’s	mental	focus	upwards	to
the	crown	of	the	head	whenever	strong	fear	arises.
Then,	when	‘sudden	death’	does	occur,	as	when	falling	straight	over	a	steep
precipice,	the	thought	will	arise,	‘I	am	dying!’	As	soon	as	this	happens,	it	would
be	best	if	one	were	to	fervently	recall	one’s	spiritual	teacher,	or	recall	one’s
particular	meditational	deity,	[as	being	present,	seated]	on	the	crown	of	one’s
head.	Even	if	there	is	not	sufficient	time	to	make	this	recollection,	it	is	essential
to	project	one’s	mental	focus	upwards	towards	the	crown	of	one’s	head.	The
reason	for	doing	so	is	that	even	[ordinarily]	now,	when	strong	fear	arises,	we
tend	to	cry	out,	‘O	father!	spiritual	teacher!’	[Similarly]	therefore,	at	the	moment
[of	sudden	death]	also,	it	is	certainly	possible	that	one	will	recollect	one’s
teacher,	 or	 [if	 one	 has	 trained	 in	 this	 practice]	 that	 one	 will	 focus	 one’s
awareness	at	the	crown	of	one’s	head	[instinctively

itting	and	inciting	them.
Please	direct	your	enlightened	compassion	towards	us!
Grant	us	purification,	and	bestow	your	[spiritual]	accomplishments	upon	us!
	
Then	the	confession	should	be	recited	to	the	entire	maṇḍala	of	wrathful	deities,
and	the	request	for	forgiveness	made	in	the	following	way:
	
HŪṂ	O	herukas	of	pristine	cognition,	natural	purity	of	the	five	poisons,
[Resplendent]	amidst	flames	blazing	like	the	fire	at	the	end	of	an	aeon,
United	with	the	five	krodh
ῑ
śvar
ῑ
,	the	great	mothers	of	space;
O	four	inner	ḍākin
ῑ
s,	Gaur
ῑ
	and	your	partners,
O	outer	yogin
ῑ
s,	Pukkās
ῑ
	and	your	partners,
O	fanged	clusters	of	devourers,	Siṃhamukh
ῑ
	and	your	partners,
O	winged	[clusters]	of	the	intermediate	directions,	Gṛdhramukh
ῑ
	and	your
partners,
O	twenty-eight	
ῑ
śvar
ῑ
,	of	the	blazing	courtyard,
O	four	female	gatekeepers,	who	summon,	bind,	shackle	and	insulate
11
	at	the
four	gates:
We	who	 have	 not	even	 clearly	 visualised	the	 bodies	of	 the	 assembly	 of
wrathful	herukas,
We	who	have	failed	to	recite	sufficient	heart-mantras,
And	failed	to	stabilise	[the	actualisation	of]	the	seals,
We	who	have	failed	to	offer	adequate	feast-and	torma-offerings,
Request	the	entire	assembly	of	wrathful	deities	for	forgiveness!
	
Next,	the	following	specific	confessional	prayers	should	be	made	to	the	maṇḍala
of	the	wrathful	deities:
	
OṂ	Should	we	have	broken	our	pledge,	which	is	dangerous	to	transgress,
Having	earlier	taken	upon	us	this	supremely	secret	vow,
For	whatever	ways	we	have	contradicted	the	buddha-mind	of	the	five	families
of	herukas,
We	seek	your	forgiveness,	O	greatly	compassionate	ones!
	
Should	we	have	been	obscured	by	conceptual	grasping,
Whilst	engaged	in	the	practices	of	the	supreme	sexual	yoga,

For	whatever	ways	we	have	contradicted	the	buddha-mind	of	the	great	mother
Krodh
ῑ
śvar
ῑ
s,
We	seek	your	forgiveness,	O	[mother]	krodheśvar
ῑ
s!
	
Should	we	have	failed	to	actualise	the	sacred	substances	and	the	seals,
For	whatever	ways	we	have	contradicted	the	buddha-mind	of	the	carnivorous
Gaur
ῑ
s,
We	seek	your	forgiveness,	O	eight	mātaraḥ,	embodiments	of	the	classes	[of
consciousness]!
	
Should	 we	 have	 failed	 to	 array	 the	 offerings	 of	 flesh	 and	 blood,
12
	 in
accordance	with	the	textual	descriptions,
For	whatever	ways	we	have	contradicted	the	buddha-mind	of	the	Piśāc
ῑ
s,
Siṃhamukh
ῑ
	and	her	partners,
We	 seek	 your	 forgiveness,	 O	 ḍākin
ῑ
s,	 embodiments	 of	 the	 objects	 [of
consciousness]!
	
Should	we	have	failed	to	differentiate	between	the	four	gates:	east,	south,
west,	and	north,
For	whatever	ways	we	have	contradicted	the	buddha-mind	of	the	female
gatekeepers,	the	horse-headed	Aṅkuśā	and	her	partners,
We	seek	your	forgiveness,	O	four	female	gatekeepers	of	pristine	cognition!
Should	we	have	failed	to	subdue	[attachment	to]	the	six	realms	of	cyclic
existence,
Having	accepted	[vows],	which	are	dangerous	to	transgress,
For	 whatever	 ways	 we	 have	 contradicted	 the	 buddha-mind	 of	 the	 seven
mothers	and	four	sisters,
13
We	seek	your	forgiveness,	O	eleven	ḍākin
ῑ
s!
	
Should	we	have	allowed	our	resources	to	become	exhausted	and	the	first	fruits
of	the	feast-offerings	to	be	spoiled,
For	whatever	ways	we	have	contradicted	the	buddha-mind	of	the	Iśvar
ῑ
	who
monitor	the	first	fruits	[of	the	feast-offerings],
We	seek	your	forgiveness,	O	twenty-eight	
ῑ
śvar
ῑ
!
	
Should	we	have	failed	to	remain	unmovingly	in	the	sacred	abodes,	but	instead

engaged	in	[distracted]	activities,
For	whatever	ways	we	have	contradicted	the	buddha-mind	of	the	wardens	of
the	sacred	abodes,
14
We	seek	your	forgiveness,	O	great	wardens	of	the	sacred	abodes!
	
Should	we	have	failed	to	regard	our	personal	[spiritual	teacher]	as	our	parent,
For	whatever	ways	we	have	contradicted	the	buddha-mind	of	the	vajra-master,
We	seek	your	forgiveness,	O	regal	vajra[-master]!
	
Should	we	have	failed	to	master	meditative	stability,
And	failed	to	distinguish	[the	characteristics	of]	the	Peaceful	and	Wrathful
Deities,
For	whatever	ways	we	have	cont

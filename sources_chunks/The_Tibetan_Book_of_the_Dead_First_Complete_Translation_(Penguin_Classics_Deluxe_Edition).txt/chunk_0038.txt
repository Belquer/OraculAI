mself,
Continuously	mistaking	others	for	himself.
	
[Similarly],	since	one	does	not	discern	the	abiding	nature,
Which	is	the	fundamental	reality	of	[all]	things,
One	is	cast	into	cyclic	existence,	not	knowing	that	appearances	are	to	be
identified	with	the	mind,
And,	not	discerning	one’s	own	mind	to	be	buddha,	nirvāṇa	becomes	obscured.
The	[apparent]	dichotomy	between	cyclic	existence	and	
nirvāṇa	is	due	to	[the
dichotomy	between]	ignorance	and	awareness,
But	there	is	[in	reality]	no	temporal	divide	between	these	two,	[even]	by	a
single	moment.
	
Seeing	the	mind	as	extraneous	to	oneself	is	indeed	bewildering,
Yet	bewilderment	and	non-bewilderment	are	of	a	single	essence.
Since	there	exists	no	[intrinsic]	dichotomy	in	the	mental	continuum	of	sentient
beings,
The	uncontrived	nature	of	mind	is	liberated	just	by	being	left	in	its	natural
state.
Yet	if	you	remain	unaware	that	bewilderment	[originates]	in	the	mind,

You	will	never	understand	the	meaning	of	actual	reality.
So	you	should	observe	that	which	naturally	arises	and	naturally	originates
within	your	own	[mind].
[First],	observe	[the	source]	from	which	these	appearances	initially	originated,
[Second,	observe	the	place]	in	which	they	abide	in	the	interim,
And	[third,	observe	the	place]	to	which	they	will	finally	go.
Then,	one	will	find	that,	just	as,	for	example,	a	pond-dwelling	crow	does	not
stray	from	its	pond,
Even	though	it	flies	away	from	the	pond,
Similarly,	although	appearances	arise	from	the	mind,
They	arise	from	the	mind	and	subside	into	the	mind	of	their	own	accord.
	
This	nature	of	mind,	which	is	all-knowing,	aware	of	everything,	empty	and
radiant,
Is	 established	 to	 be	 the	 manifestly	 radiant	 and	 self-originating	 pristine
cognition,
[Present]	from	the	beginning,	just	like	the	sky,
As	an	indivisible	[union]	of	emptiness	and	radiance.
This	itself	is	actual	reality.
The	indication	that	this	is	[the	actual	reality]	is	that	all	phenomenal	existence
is	perceived	in	[the	single	nature	of]	one’s	own	mind;
And	this	nature	of	mind	is	aware	and	radiant.
Therefore,	recognise	[this	nature]	to	be	like	the	sky!
However,	this	example	of	the	sky,	though	used	to	illustrate	actual	reality,
Is	merely	a	symbol,	a	partial	and	provisional	illustration.
For	the	nature	of	mind	is	aware,	empty	and	radiant	in	all	respects,
While	the	sky	is	without	awareness,	empty,	inanimate	and	void.
Therefore,	the	true	understanding	of	the	nature	of	mind	is	not	illustrated	by
[the	metaphor	of]	the	sky.
[To	achieve	this	understanding],	let	the	mind	remain	in	its	own	state,	without
distraction!
[THE	NATURE	OF	APPEARANCES]
Now,	with	regard	to	the	diversity	of	relative	appearances:

They	are	all	perishable;	not	one	of	them	is	genuinely	existent.
All	phenomenal	existence,	all	the	things	of	cyclic	existence	and	nirvāṇa,
Are	the	discernible	manifestations	of	the	unique	essential	nature	of	one’s	own
mind.
[This	is	known	because]	whenever	one’s	own	mental	continuum	undergoes
change,
There	will	arise	the	discernible	manifestation	of	an	external	change.
Therefore,	all	things	are	the	discernible	manifestations	of	mind.
For	example,	the	six	classes	of	living	beings	discern	phenomenal	appearances
in	their	differing	ways:
Eternalistic	 extremists	 [and	 others]	 who	 are	 remote	 from	 [the	 Buddhist
perspective],
Perceive	[appearances]	in	terms	of	a	dichotomy	of	eternalism	and	nihilism;
And	[followers	of]	the	nine	sequences	of	the	vehicle	perceive	[appearances]	in
terms	of	their	respective	views,	[and	so	forth].
For	as	long	as	this	diversity	[of	appearances]	is	being	perceived	and	diversely
elucidated,
Differences	[as	to	the	nature	of	appearances]	are	apprehended,
And	consequently,	bewilderment	comes	about	through	attachment	to	those
respective	[views].
Yet,	even	though	all	those	appearances,	of	which	one	is	aware	in	one’s	own
mind,
Do	arise	as	discernible	manifestations,
Buddhahood	is	present	[simply]	when	they	are	not	subjectively	apprehended
or	grasped.
Bewilderment	does	not	come	about	on	account	of	these	appea

Pristine	Cognition

jñāna

The	 modality	 of	
buddha-mind
.	 Although	 all	
sentient	 beings
	 possess	 the
potential	for	actualising	pristine	cognition	within	their	mental	continuum,	the
psychological	confusions	and	deluded	tendencies	which	defile	the	
mind
	obstruct
the	natural	expression	of	these	inherent	potentials,	making	them	appear	instead
as	aspects	of	mundane	
consciousness
	(
vijñāna
).	Buddhist	literature	mentions
five	types	of	pristine	cognition	which	are	the	quintessential	perfected	states	of
our	own	mental	faculties	and	which	are	identified	with	the	five	male	
buddhas
	of
the	
maṇḍala
	 of	
Peaceful	 and	 Wrathful	 Deities
.	 See	 Appendix	 Two.	 The
pristine	cognition	of	
reality’s	expanse
	
(
dharmadhātujñāna
)	is	the	natural	purity
of	the	
aggregate	of	consciousness
,	free	from	
delusion
;	the	mirror-like	pristine
cognition	(
ādarśajñāna
)	is	the	mind	to	which	all	the	objects	of	the	five	senses
appear	spontaneously	as	in	a	mirror,	it	is	the	natural	purity	of	the	
aggregate	of
form
,	free	from	
aversion
;	the	pristine	cognition	of	sameness	(
samatājñāna
)	is
the	mind	that	experiences	the	three	different	types	of	feelings	(good,	bad	and
indifferent)	as	of	one	taste,	it	is	the	natural	purity	of	the	
aggregate	of	feeling
,
free	from	pride;	the	pristine	cognition	of	discernment	(
pratyavekṣaṇajñāna
)	is
the	mind	that	accurately	identifies	names	and	forms,	it	is	the	natural	purity	of	the
aggregate	of	perceptions
,	free	from	
attachment
;	and	the	
pristine	cognition	of
accomplishment	(
kṛtyupasthānajñāna
)	is	the	mind	that	accords	with	awakened
activities	 and	 their	 purposes,	 it	 is	 the	 natural	 purity	 of	 the	
aggregate	 of
motivational	tendencies
,	free	from	envy	and	self-centred	ambition.

Prostration
	
phyag-’tshal-ba
A	common	gesture	of	reverence	in	the	practice	of	Tibetan	Buddhism.	During	the
preliminary	practices
	(
sngon-’gro
)	of	the	
tantras
,	the	act	of	paying	homage
through	prostration	is	undertaken,	in	conjunction	with	the	recitation	of	the	prayer
of	
refuge
,	as	a	means	of	reducing	and	eliminating	
pride
.
	
Protectors	of	the	[Sacred]	Teachings
	
chos-skyong/srung-ma

There	are	two	main	categories	of	protectors:	1)	supramundane	protectors,	such
as	
Mahākāla
,	
Ekajaṭ
ῑ
,	
Dorje	 Lekpa
,	 and	
Rāhula
,	 who	 are	 the	
wrathful
manifestations	of	
enlightened
	beings;	and	2)	worldly	protectors,	many	of	whom
were	originally	
malevolent	forces
	who	were	subdued	by	
accomplished	masters
such	as	
Padmasambhava
	
and	then	assigned	to	protect	the	teachings.	In	both

cases	their	activity	is	to	protect	the	
sacred	teachings
	and	its	sincere	practitioners
from	obstacles.

Pure	Vision/Perception
	
dag-pa’i	snang-ba
In	 the	 terminology	 of	 the	
Nyingma
	 school,	 the	 expression	 ‘pure	 vision’
frequently	refers	to	a	type	of	revelation,	through	which	
meditational	deities
	or
accomplished	masters
	of	the	past	appear	in	a	vision	to	impart	their	teachings.
This	mode	of	pure	vision,	therefore,	has	some	affinity	with	the	revelations	of	the
treasures
	 (
gter-ma
).	 More	 generally,	 ‘pure	 vision’	 denotes	 the	 purity	 of
perception	of	
meditational	deities,
	symbolically	represented	by	their	respective
maṇḍalas
,	which	is	cultivated	in	the	
generation	stage
	of	meditation.	However,
the	Tibetan	equivalent	
dag-pa’i	snang-ba
	is	also	used	colloquially	to	mean	a
‘positive	perspective’	or	‘positive	outlook’	on	life.

).	The	natural	arising	of	
inner	radiance
immediately	after	respiration	ceases	is	regarded	as	a	supreme	opportunity	to
realise	the	
Buddha-body	of	Reality
.	See	Chapters	3,	8,	10	and	1	1.
	
Intrinsic	Awareness
	
rang-rig
,	Skt.	
svasaṃvitti/svasaṃvedana
According	to	Indian	Buddhist	epistemology,	and	particularly	in	the	writings	of
the	great	logicians	
Dignāga
	and	
Dharmak
ῑ
rti
,	the	term	
svasaṃvedana
	refers	to
the	apperceptive	or	reflexive	faculty	of	consciousness,	for	which	reason	it	is
sometimes	 rendered	 as	 ‘reflexive	 awareness’	 or	 ‘apperceptive	 awareness’.
However,	in	the	view	of	the	
Great	Perfection
	(
rdzogs-pa	chen-po
)	and	in	the
context	of	the	present	work,	the	same	term	refers	to	the	fundamental	innate	mind
in	its	natural	state	of	spontaneity	and	purity,	beyond	the	alternating	states	of
motion	and	rest	and	the	subject-object	dichotomy.	It	is	therefore	rendered	here	as
‘intrinsic	awareness’.	As	such,	intrinsic	awareness	gives	the	meditator	access	to
pristine	cognition
	or	the	
biddha-mind
	itself,	and	it	stands	in	direct	contrast	to
fundamental	ignorance
	(
avidyā
	
),	which	is	the	primary	cause	of	rebirth	in
cyclic	existence
	(
saṃsāra
).	The	direct	
introduction
	to	intrinsic	awareness	is	a
distinctive	teaching	within	the	
Nyingma
	
school	and	the	principal	subject	matter
of	Chapter	4.	This	practice	is	a	central	component	of	the	
Esoteric	Instructional
Class
	(
upadeśa
)	of	
Atiyoga
,	where	it	is	known	as	
Cutting	throuth	Resistance
(
khregs-chod
).	See	also	
Awareness
	and

.
	
Intrinsic	Awareness	which	is	Pristine	Cognition
	
rang	rig-pa’i	ye-shes
Generally	this	term	refers	to	the	
pristine	cognition
	arising	from	the	direct
realisation	of	
emptiness
	by	a	
sublime	being
	(
ārya
,	 Tib.	
’phags-pa
)	 in	 the
context	of	deep	
meditative	equipoise
.	This	is	so	called	because	the	nature	and
qualities	of	that	experience	can	never	be	fully	conveyed	by	means	of	language
and	words	but	remains	totally	evident	to	the	
yogin
	himself.	In	the	context	of	the
Great	 Perfection
	 however,	 as	 exemplified	 by	 our	 text,	 the	 fusion	 of	 the

meditator’s	intrinsic	awareness	with	the	pristine	cognition	of	
buddha-mind
indicates	not	only	that	intrinsic	awareness	
provides	access	to	
buddha-mind
,	but
that	the	identity	of	the	two	has	been	fully	realised.	See	also	
Intrinsic	Awareness
and	
Pristine	Cognition

actual	reality
	or	
intrinsic
awareness
	
is	formally	introduced	(

Invitation
	
spyan-’dren-pa
,	Skt.	
upanimantraṇa
	
The	term	‘invitation’	refers	to
the	meditative	process	of	the	
tantras
,	whereby	the	actual	
meditational	deity
	or
Being	of	Pristine	Cognition
	(	
jñānasattva
,	Tib.	
ye-shes	sems-dpa’
)	is	formally
invited	by	the	meditator	to	enter	into	the	previously	visualised	form,	known	as
the	
Being	of	Commitment
	(
samayasattva
,	Tib.	
dam-tshig	sems-dpa’

Kagyu
	
bka’-brgyud
One	of	the	four	main	traditions	or	schools	of	Tibetan	Buddhism.	The	
Kagyu
lineage	tradition	stems	from	the	great	
acomplished	masters
	(
mahāsiddha
)	of
India	such	as	
Tilopa
,	
Naropa
	and	
Maitripa
	through	to	
Khyungpo	Neljor
,	who
founded	the	
Shangpa	Kagyu
	lineage,	and	
Marpa	Lotsāwa
,	who	formed	the
Dagpo	Kagyu
	lineage.	The	latter	comprises	four	major	sub-schools,	namely	the
Karmapa
,	the	
Tshalpa
,	the	
Barompa
	and	the	
Phagmodrupa
,	the	last	of	which	is
further	divided	into	the	branches	of	the	
Drigungpa
,	
Taglungpa
,	
Drukpa
,	
Yazang
,
Trophu
,	
Shugseb
,	
Yelpa
,	and	
Martshang
.	These	traditions	integrate	practices
derived	from	both	the	
sūtras
	
and	the	
tantras
.	There	is	a	particular	emphasis	on
the	
Great	 Seal
(
Mahāmudrā
)	 system	 of	 practice	 and	 on	
perfection	 stage
practices	such	as	the	Six	Yogas	of	
Naropa
.

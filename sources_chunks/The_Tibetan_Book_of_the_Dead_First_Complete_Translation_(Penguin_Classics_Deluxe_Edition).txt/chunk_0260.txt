Mind
	
sems,
	Skt.	
citta
In	 Buddhism,	 mind	 is	 defined	 as	 a	 dynamic	 process,	 which	 is	 simply	 the
awareness	of	an	object	or	event.	In	its	technical	usage	mind	is	contrasted	with
fifty-one	
mental	factors
,	which	are	enumerated	in	the	
abhidharma
	literature.	In
the	context	of	this	differentiation	the	primary	function	of	‘mind’	is	to	be	aware	of
the	referent	object	as	a	whole,	whereas	the	modalities	which	relate	to	the	specific
aspects	 of	 the	 object	 are	 defined	 as	 ‘
mental	 factors
’.	 It	 is	 important	 to
understand	that	mind	in	Buddhism	should	not	be	conceived	of	as	a	static	thing	or
as	 something	 composed	 of	 a	 spiritual	 substance.	 Although	 some	 Buddhist
philosophical	schools	of	thought	do	identify	mind	as	the	essence	of	being	or
personal	identity,	the	notion	of	self	or	person	is	not	an	essential	component	of	the
Buddhist	concept	of	mind.	In	the	
Dzogchen
	teachings	an	important	distinction	is
made	between	the	Tibetan	terms	‘
sems
’	and	‘
rig-pa
’.	Here,	our	‘ordinary	mind’
(
sems
)	 is	 the	 gross	 dualising	
consciousness
	 (
rnam-shes
)	 whereas	 pure
awareness
	(
rig-pa
)	is	free	from	the	dualistic	perceptions	of	subject	and	object.

Mindfulness	is	the	faculty	which	enables	the
mind
	 to	 maintain	 its	 attention	 on	 a	 referent	 object,	 thus	 allowing	 for	 the
development	of	familiarity	with	the	object	and	also	the	ability	to	retain	its
imprint	within	memory	for	future	recollection.	Together	with	mental	alertness,	it
is	one	of	the	two	indispensable	
mental	factors
	for	the	development	of	
calm
abiding
.	It	is	mindfulness	which	counteracts	the	arising	of	
forgetfulness,	and
forgetfulness	 is	 one	 of	 the	 greatest	 obstacles	 to	 a	 successful	 cultivation	 of
meditative	stability

Monastic	Community
	
dge-’dun
,	Skt.	
saṅgha
In	 its	 classical	 Buddhist	 usage,	 the	 term	 refers	 mainly	 to	 the	 spiritual
communities	 of	 ordained	 practitioners,	 both	 monks	 and	 nuns	 (Skt.	
bhikṣu/
bhikṣuṇ
ῑ
).	The	actual	
saṅgha
,	when	viewed	as	an	object	of	
refuge
	in	the	context
of	the	
Three	Precious	Jewels
,	is	a	highly	realised,	‘supreme	assembly’	of	those
who	have	gained	a	direct	insight	into	the	true	nature	of	
reality
	-	
emptiness
	(i.e.
those	who	have	attained	the	path	of	insight).
	

Monastic	Preceptor
	
mkhan-po
,	Skt.	
upādhyāya
The	term	monastic	preceptor	specifically	indicates	one	who	presides	over	the
monastic	 ordination	 ceremony	 of	 new	 monks.	 However,	 in	 some	 Tibetan
traditions,	the	word	‘
khenpo
’	(
mkhan-po
)	suggests	an	ordained	professor	of
Buddhist	philosophy,	in	which	case	it	is	equivalent	to	the	term	
geshe
	(
dge-shes
)
in	its	later	usage.	See	
Spiritual	Friend
.	The	same	term	can	also	be	used	to	refer
to	the	abbot	of	a	monastery,	in	which	case	it	often	takes	the	honorific	form
mkhan	rin-po-che
,	the	precious	abbot.

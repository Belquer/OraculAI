Six	Perfections
	
pha-rol-tu	phyin-pa	drug

ṣaṭāramitā
In	the	
sūtra
	system	of	the	path	to	
buddhahood
,	the	entire	
bodhisattva
’s	way	of
life	 or	 conduct	 is	 founded	 upon	 the	 practice	 of	 the	 six	 perfections	 which
comprise:	 generosity	 (
dāna
),	 ethical	 discipline	 (
ś
ῑ
la
),	 patience	 (
kṣānti
),
perseverance	or	joyous	effort	(
v
ῑ
rya
),	
meditative	concentration
	(
dhyāna
),	and
discrminative	awareness
	
(
prajñā
).	These	six	are	known	as	‘perfections’	when,
for	 example,	 the	 practice	 of	 generosity	 is:	 1)	 motivated	 by	 the	
altruistic
intention	to	attain	enlightenment
	for	the	sake	of	all	beings;	2)	undertaken
within	a	sixfold	combination	of	all	the	perfections;	and	3)	performed	with	an
awareness	of	the	
emptiness
	(
śūnyatā
)	of	the	agent,	the	act,	and	the	object	in
question.	As	an	aspiration,	the	word	
pāramitā
	is	used	to	denote	a	means	to
perfection;	 but	 when	 describing	 the	 perfected	 result,	 at	 the	 attainment	 of
buddhahood
,	 it	 means	 ‘transcendent	 perfection’,	 in	 accord	 with	 its	 literal
meaning,	‘gone	beyond’.

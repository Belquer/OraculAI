deity
Vajrasattva,	is	a	title	generally	given	to	accomplished	exponents	of	the	Vehicle
of	Indestructible	Reality	(
Vajrayāna
).

This	prayer	for	total	union	with	the	deity	is	repeated	below,	p.	21,	at	the	end
of	the	section	on	union	with	the	spiritual	teacher	(
guruyoga
).	As	to	the	specified
indications	of	this	union,	the	body	size	(
kāya
;	Tib.	
sku’i	tshad
)	and	lifespan	of
Vajrasattva	(
āyuḥ
;	Tib.	
tshe
)	are	those	of	a	buddha,	on	which	see	P.	Williams,

Mahāyāna	Buddhism
,	pp.	181-4;	his	retinue	(
parivāra
;	Tib.	
’khor
)	comprises
male	and	female	bodhisattvas,	on	which	see	Ch.	5,	p.	68;	and	his	field	(
kṣetra
;
Tib.	
zhing-khams
)	is	Abhirati	on	which	see	Ch.	11,	p.	239.	For	the	significance

The	initial	mantra	of	the	external	mandala	of	offerings:	OṂ	VAJRA	BHŪMI
ĀḤ	HŪṂ	indicates	that	the	foundation	or	base	of	the	symbolic	mandala	is	of	the
nature	of	indestructible	reality	(
vajra
;	Tib.	
rdo-rje
).	Simultaneously,	the
practitioner	sprinkles	consecrated	substances	upon	it.	See	Paltrul	Rinpoche,

Words	of	My	Perfect	Teacher
,	p.	287;	and	Sonam	T.	Kazi	(trans.),

may	Zhal-lung
,	p.	400.

The	foundation	of	the	maṇḍala	is	considered	to	be	an	immensely	thick
indestructible	circle	of	wind,	resting	upon	space,	and	surmounted	by	a	circle	of
water	and	a	sphere	of	gold.	See	L.	Pruden	(trans.),	
Abhidharmakośabhāṣyaṃ
,
Ch.	3,	The	World,	pp.	451-2.
20
	
The	second	mantra	of	the	mandala	of	offerings:	OṂ	VAJRA	REKHE	ĀḤ
HŪṂ	indicates	that	the	
cakravāḍa
	or	‘perimeter	wall’	of	the	maṇḍala	is	of	the
nature	of	indestructible	reality.	Simultaneously,	the	practitioner	makes	a
clockwise	circular	motion	with	the	right	hand,	and	places	a	flower	blossom	on
the	surface	of	the	maṇḍala,	followed	by	the	outer	ring.	See	Paltrul	Rinpoche,	
The
Words	of	My	Perfect	Teacher
,	p.	287;	and	Sonam	T.	Kazi	(trans.),

On	the	perception	of	the	sun	(
sūrya
;	Tib.	
nyi-ma
)	and	moon	(
candra
;	Tib.	
zla-
ba
)	from	the	perspective	of	Abhidharma,	see	L.	Pruden	(trans.),
Abhidharmakośabhāṣyaṃ
	
,	pp.	460-62;	and	R.	Kloetzli,

pp.	45-6.	Rāhu	(

dus-me
)	are	identified	as	the	ascending
and	descending	phases	of	the	moon.

The	syllables	OṂ	ĀṂ	HŪṂ	respectively	symbolise	buddha-body,	speech
and	mind,	for	which	reason,	in	the	context	of	the	present	work,	they	frequently
appear	at	the	beginning	of	verses	as	an	invocation.	See	Ch.	5,	pp.	67ff.	The	three
verses	which	follow	respectively	concern	the	outer,	inner,	and	secret	
maṇḍala	of
offerings	which	are	made	respectively	to	the	Buddha-body	of	Emanation
(
nirmāṇakāya
),	the	Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource	(
sambhogakāya
	
),	and	the
Buddha-body	of	Reality	(
dharmakāya
).	On	the	construction	of	these	three

maṇḍalas,	see	Paltrul	Rinpoche,	
The	Words	of	My	Perfect	Teacher
,	pp.	288-95;
and	Sonam	T.	Kazi	(trans.),

,	Pt.	2,	pp.	403-4.
23
	
The	ultimate	nature	of	mind	(
sems-nyid
)	is	identified	with	the	Buddha-body
of	Reality	(
dharmakāya
).	For	a	detailed	introduction	to	the	nature	of	mind,
within	the	context	of	the	present	work,	see	Ch.	4,	pp.	38-57.

that	a	cloud	of	offerings	is	presented	to	the	precious	maṇḍala	of	the	spiritual

class	of	geomantic	forces	whose	position	rotates	-	in	some	cases	according	to	the
years	of	the	sexagenary	calendar,	and	in	others	according	to	the	months	of	the
year,	the	days	of	the	month,	and	the	hours	of	the	day.	It	is	regarded	as	important
that	the	subterranean	locations	of	the	spirit	lords	should	be	known	at	the	time	of
constructing	a	building	or	
maṇḍala
,	and	before	entering	into	specific	activities.

Spiritual	Friend
	
dge-ba’i	bshes-gsnyen/dge-bshes

The	term	‘spiritual	friend’	refers	to	a	
spiritual	teacher
	(Skt.	
guru
)	who	can
contribute	to	an	individual’s	progress	on	the	spiritual	path	to	
enlightenment
	and
who	acts	wholeheartedly	for	the	welfare	of	his	or	her	students,	adopting	a
renunciate	lifestyle.	In	Tibet,	during	the	eleventh	and	twelfth	centuries,	the	term
became	synonymous	with	the	great	masters	of	the	
Kadam
	school,	who	combined
a	scrupulously	renunciate	lifestyle	and	deep	humility	with	profound	scholarship
and	meditative	resolve.	In	later	centuries,	the	Tibetan	abbreviation	
geshe
	came	to
have	an	academic	usage	in	the	
Gelug
	school,	where	it	now	identifies	a	scholar-
monk	with	a	doctorate	title	in	traditional	Buddhist	studies,	and	is	similar	to	the
modern	usage	of	the	term	‘
khenpo
’	(
mkhan-po
)	in	other	traditions.	See	also

universal	spiritual	siblings,	
i.e.
	all	sentient	beings	who	from	beginningless	time
have	been	one’s	parents;	2)	spiritual	siblings	who	share	the	Buddhist	teachings;
3)	harmonious	spiritual	siblings,	who	are	similar	in	view	and	conduct;	4)	dear
spiritual	 siblings,	 who	 share	 the	 same	
spiritual	 teacher
;	 5)	 close	 spiritual
siblings,	who	receive	teaching	together;	and	6)	intimate	spiritual	siblings,	who
receive	
empowerment
	together.
	
Spiritual	Teacher
	
bla-ma
,	Skt.	
guru
The	original	Sanskrit	word	
‘guru
’	literally	means	‘heavy’	or	‘weighty’,	and	by
extension	a	‘venerable	teacher’.	The	Tibetan	equivalent	‘
bla-ma
’	(pronounced
lama
)	means	‘unsurpassed’	or	‘supreme’,	indicating	that	the	
guru
	is	unsurpassed
in	terms	of	being	the	perfect	object	towards	which	meritorious	activity	should	be
directed.	 However,	 it	 is	 important	 to	 note	 that	 specific	 qualifications	 are
necessary	in	order	to	be	considered	as	a	spiritual	teacher.	These	qualifications
differ	according	to	the	level	of	spiritual	practice	at	which	a	teacher	is	adopted.	In

the	context	of	the	
tantras
,	the	spiritual	teacher	is	said	to	confer	
blessings
	on	the
meditator,	 in	 contrast	 to	 the	
meditational	 deity
,	 who	 confers	 supreme
accomplishment
	and	the	
ḍākin
ῑ
,	who	confer	enlightened	or	
buddha	activities
.
Ultimately,	the	
guru
	is	one’s	own	
buddha	nature

primordial	purity	(
ka-dag

buddhahood
,	the
Buddha-body	of	Reality
,	the	realisation	of	which	is	approached	through	the
practices	of	
Cutting	through	Resistance
	(
khregs-chod
),	as	described	in	Chapter
4,	and	spontaneous	
presence	refers	to	the	expressive	nature	of	the	
Buddha-body
of	Reality
	as	the	
Buddha-body	of	Form
,	the	realisation	of	which	is	approached
through	the	practices	of	
All-surpassing	Realisation
	(
thod-rgal
	),	as	indicated	in
the	emergence	of	the	luminosities	described	in	Chapter	11.	More	generally,	this
term	refers	to	spontaneous	or	effortless	activity,	the	fifth	of	the	five	kinds	of
buddha	activity
,	according	to	the	
Mahāyoga
	texts.

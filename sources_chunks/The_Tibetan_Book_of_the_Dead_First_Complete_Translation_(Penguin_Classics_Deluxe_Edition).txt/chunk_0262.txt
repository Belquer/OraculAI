Natural	Transformation
	
gnas	gyur-pa
In	contrast	to	the	term	‘
natural	purity
’,	the	term	‘natural	transformation’	refers
to	the	transformative	energies	of	the	fifty-eight	
wrathful	deities
	of	the	
maṇḍala
,
which	bring	about	the	active	transformation	of	the	conditioned	
psycho-physical
aggregates
	
,	
elemental	properties
,	and	sensory	and	mental	processes.	‘Natural
transformation’	indicates	the	presence	of	the	assembly	of	
wrathful	deities
	in	the
continuum	of	the	ground
.	See	Appendix	Two.
	
Naturally	Manifest
	
rang-snang
In	the	terminology	of	the	
Nyingma
	school,	the	term	‘naturally	manifest’	or
‘intrinsically	manifest’	(
rang-snang
)	refers	to	the	non-dual	mode	in	which	the
natural	radiance	(
rang-gsal
)	of	
pristine	cognition
	(
ye-shes
)	arises	as	
intrinsic
awareness
	
(
rang-rig
).	See	
Intrinsic	Awareness
.	An	important	distinction	is	also
made	 between	 the	
Buddha-body	 of	 Perfect	 Resource
,	 which	 manifests
naturally	or	intrinsically,	and	the	
Buddha-body	of	Emanation
,	which	manifests
extraneously	(
gzhan-snang
),	for	the	sake	of	sentient	beings.
	
Negativity
	
sdig-pa
,	Skt.	
pāpa
The	negativity	arising	from	the	performance	of	
non-virtuous	 past	 actions
,
which,	along	with	negative	
obscurations
	(
sgrib
)	and	their	
habitual	tendencies

(
bag-chag
),	 all	 have	 their	 basis	 in	
delusion
,	
attachment
,	 and	
aversion
.
Negativity,	therefore,	generates	a	momentum	towards	a	less	favourable	rebirth
within	
cyclic	existence

Nihilism	and	
eternalism
	are	the	two	extreme	views	which	must,	according	to
Buddhist	thought,	be	transcended	in	order	for	any	philosophical	position	to	be
considered	well-founded.	Nihilism	in	general	refers	to	the	view	that	denies	the
existence	of	objects,	laws	of	
cause	and	effect
	and	the	principle	of	
dependent
origination
	
.	However,	based	on	one’s	metaphysical	position	with	regard	to	the
nature	of	
reality
,	the	criteria	of	what	constitutes	a	denial	of	the	existence	of
phenomena	or	the	law	of	
cause	and	effect
	may	differ.	In	ancient	India	the
nihilist	view	was	characteristic	of	the	
Carvāka
	and	
Bārhaspatya
	 materialist
schools.	See

In	the	
Nyingma
	school,	the	Buddhist	teachings	are	systematised	according	to	a
hierarchy	of	the	three	outer	or	causal	
vehicles
	(those	of	the	
pious	attendants
,
hermit	buddhas
	and	
bodhisattvas
),	those	of	the	three	outer	classes	of	
tantra
(

Yogatantra

classes	of

Nirvāna
	
myang-’das
Nirvāṇa
	(lit.	‘state	beyond	sorrow’)	refers	to	the	permanent	cessation	of	all
suffering
	
and	the	
dissonant	mental	states
	which	cause	and	perpetuate	suffering,
along	with	all	misapprehension	with	regard	to	the	nature	of	
emptiness
	(Skt
.
śūnyatā
).	
Nirvāṇa
	
is	therefore	the	antithesis	of	
cyclic	existence
	(Skt.	
saṃsāra
).
Since	it	is	through	the	misapprehension	of	the	nature	of	
actual	reality
	(Skt
.
dharmatā
)	that	our	conscious	states	of	delusion	arise,	a	total	elimination	of	these
dissonant	mental	states
	can	only	be	effected	by	generating	a	genuine	insight
into	the	true	nature	of	
actual	reality
.	All	the	
bodhisattva
	
paths
	expounded	in	the
sūtras
	and	all	the	aspects	of	the	
continuum	of	the	path
	which	are	expounded	in

the	
tantras
	are	regarded	as	the	means	by	which	
nirvāṇa
	might	be	attained.

nirvāṇa

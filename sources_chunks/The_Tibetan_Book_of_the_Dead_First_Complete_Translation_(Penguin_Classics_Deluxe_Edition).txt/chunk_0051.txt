lding	a	noose	of	snakes.
O	you,	the	six	yogin
ῑ
	from	the	north,	who	enact	the	rites	of	wrath,
Perform	 the	 rites	 which	 utterly	 destroy	 the	 confused	 perceptions	 of	 the
intermediate	state!

At	the	[outer]	eastern	gate	of	one’s	skull	is	Vajrā	[Mahākāl

],
White,	cuckoo-headed,	and	holding	an	iron	hook;
At	the	[outer]	southern	gate	of	one’s	skull	is	Vajrā	[Mahāchāgalā],
Yellow,	goat-headed,	and	holding	a	noose;
At	the	[outer]	western	gate	of	one’s	skull	is	Vajrā	[Mahākumbhakarṇ
ῑ
],
Red,	lion-headed,	and	holding	an	iron	chain;
And	at	the	[outer]	northern	gate	of	one’s	skull	is	Vajrā	[Lambodarā],
Dark	green,	snake-headed,	and	holding	a	bell.
O	 you,	 the	 four	 female	 gatekeepers,	 Queens	 [of	 Yoga]	 who	 enact	 the
emanational	rites,
Perform	the	rites	which	obstruct	the	doors	[leading]	to	[mundane]	rebirth	from

the	intermediate	state!

OṂ	ĀḤ	HŪṂ
To	you,	the	Twenty-eight	Iśvar
ῑ
,	Queens	of	Yoga,
I	bow	down,	make	offerings,	take	refuge,	and	pray:
As	soon	as	we	die	and	begin	to	transmigrate,
At	that	very	moment,	when	the	visions	of	the	intermediate	state	of	reality
dawn,
And	we	roam	[alone]	in	cyclic	existence	[driven]	by	deep-seated	confused
perceptions,
May	the	seven	Iśvar
ῑ
	of	the	east	draw	us	forward,
Leading	us	on	the	path	of	radiant	light,
Which	is	[a	vibrance	of]	sounds,	lights	and	rays.
May	the	seven	Iśvar
ῑ
	of	the	south	support	us	from	behind,
May	the	seven	Iśvar
ῑ
	of	the	west	support	us	from	the	perimeter,
And	may	the	seven	Iśvar
ῑ
	of	the	north	destroy	[and	liberate]	our	enemies,
And	thus	[encircled]	may	we	be	rescued
From	the	fearsome	passageway	of	the	intermediate	state,
And	be	escorted	to	the	level	of	an	utterly	perfected	buddha.
	
OṂ	ĀḤ	HŪṂ
At	this	time	when	we	dwell	within	the	intermediate	state	of	living,
The	assembly	of	the	sixty	blood-drinking	deities
28
Is	radiantly	present	within	the	celestial	palace	of	the	skull,	at	the	crown-centre,
within	one’s	brain	—
Embodied	in	the	form	of	a	cluster	of	five-coloured	lights.
Yet,	as	soon	as	we	die	and	begin	to	transmigrate,
This	assembly	of	blood-drinking	deities	will	emerge	from	the	brain,
And	appear	[before	us],	filling	the	entire	trichiliocosm.
[Each	of]	the	central	and	peripheral	[forms]
Will	be	endowed	with	fearsome	ornaments	and	attire.
[Resounding]	within	an	immense	space,
Vibrant	with	sounds,	lights	and	rays,
The	bodily	demeanour	of	these	wrathful	deities
Will	be	elegant,	heroic	and	terrifying,
Their	roar	wild,	murderous	and	awesome,

Each	blazing	with	compassion,	wrath	and	fierce	aversion,
Adorned	by	face	markings	of	human	ash,	blood,	and	grease;
29
Dressed	in	skirts	of	moist	hide	and	flayed	tiger	skin;
Decorated	with	skull	garlands	and	wreaths	of	snakes;
Resplendent	in	a	blazing	mass	of	fire	which	pounds
With	the	cries	of	‘HA	HA	HŪṂ	PHAṬ	Strike!	Slay!’,
Reverberating	like	a	thousand	peals	of	thunder.
Fully	arrayed	with	hand-emblems	and	multifarious	faces,
Displaying	the	arts	of	transformation,
They	will	pulverise	and	rock	the	infinite	trichiliocosm.
At	that	very	moment	when	the	fierce	sounds,	lights	and	rays
Dawn	before	us	in	terrifying	manifestation,
O	you,	the	compassionate	assembly	of	wrathful	blood-drinking	deities,
O	Beings	of	Compassion,	do	not	withhold	your	compassion	at	that	[time]!
As	we	roam	[alone]	in	cyclic	existence	[driven]	by	deep-seated	habitual
tendencies,
May	the	assembly	of	wrathful	blood-drinking	[deities]	draw	us	forward,
Leading	us	on	the	path	of	[radiant]	light,
Which	is	free	of	fear	and	terrifying	perceptions!
May	the	assembly	of	wrathful	female	deities,	Queens	of	the	Expanse,	support
us	from	behind!
May	the	assembly	of	the	Mātaraḥ,	Piśāc
ῑ
,	and	Female	Gatekeepers	support	us
from	the	perimeter!
May	the	Eight	Great	Projectresses	[who	propel	beings	to	exalted	rebirths],
Propel	us	from	our	[mundane]	states	[into	higher	rebirth]!
May	the	diverse	animal-headed	Iśvar
ῑ
	eliminate	all	obstacles!
May	 the	 four	 supreme	 Female	 Gatekeepers	 obstruct	 the	 entrance	 to
[mundane]	births;
And	thus	[encircled],	may

Mount	Potālaka
	
ri-bo	po-ta-la-ka
Mount	
Potālaka
,	the	abode	of	
Avalokiteśvara
,	is	reputedly	identified	with	a
mountain	in	modern	Karnataka	State,	South	India,	according	to	the	classical
Indian	Buddhist	tradition.	However,	in	the	Chinese	Buddhist	tradition,	it	is
identified	with	the	eastern	island	of	
Putuo	Shan

Mount	Sumeru
	
ri-rab
Mount	
Sumeru
	is	the	
axis	mundi
	of	Indian	cosmology,	the	centre	of	the	world.	In

terms	of	the	Hindu,	Jain,	Buddhist	and	Bon	pilgrimage	traditions,	it	is	widely

Natural	Expression
	
rang-bzhin
,	Skt
.	svabhāva
While	the	term	
svabhāva
	conveys	other	meanings,	such	as	
self-identity
	and
inherent	existence
	in	the	contexts	of	
Madhyamaka
	philosophy	and	
sūtra
-based
literature	in	general,	here	in	the	specific	terminology	of	the	
Nyingma
	school,	it	is
rendered	 as	 ‘natural	 expression’	 because	 it	 describes	 the	 dynamic	 of	 the
Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource
.	As	such,	it	is	contrasted	with	the	essence	-
the	dynamic	of	the	
Buddha-body	of	Reality
,	and	compassionate	energy	-	the
dynamic	of	the	
Buddha-body	of	Emanation
.	The	
Buddha-body	of	Perfect
Resource
	is	said	to	be	endowed	with	seven	aspects	of	natural	expression:	1)
ripening	in	the	nature	of	
reality
,	2)	
buddha	attributes
	which	are	spontaneously
present,	3)	dimensionless	
pristine	congnition
,	4)	intrinsic	rather	than	external
manifestation,	5)	unqualified	sameness,	6)	freedom	from	single	and	multiple
concepts,	and	7)	inseparability	at	all	times.	In	the	context	of	the	present	work,
the	term	‘natural	expression’	also	refers	to	the	modalities	of	the	twenty-eight
wrathful	
Īśvar
ῑ
,	when	contrasted	with	the	‘
natural	purity
’	(
gnas-dag
)	of	the
peaceful	deities
	and	the	‘
natural	transformation
’	(
gnas-gyur
)	of	the	
wrathful
deities
.
	
Natural	Liberation
	
rang-grol
According	to	the	terminology	of	the	
Nyingma
	school	and	in	the	context	of	the
title	of	our	text	
Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities:	Natural	Liberation	through
[Recognition	of]	Enlightened	Intention
	(
Zhi-khro	dgongs-pa	rang-grol
)	the	term
‘natural	liberation’	refers	to	a	natural	process	of	recognition	of	the	actual	nature
of	the	object,	which	is	free	from	any	form	of	renunciation	or	antidote.	
Dudjom
Rinpoche
	 explains	 the	 term	 ‘natural	 liberation’	 (
rang-grol
)	 to	 mean	 that
recognition	or	awareness	is	‘uncontrived	by	any	antidote,	and	all	that	arises	is
liberated	without	reference	to	other	liberating	activities’.	This	accomplishment	is
a	distinctive	feature	of	the	resultant	
vehicles
,	such	as	
Atiyoga
,	in	contrast	to	the
causal	
vehicles
,	in	which	the	application	of	antidotes	and	
renunciation
	are

required.
	
Natural	Pristine	Cognition
	
rang-byung	ye-shes
This	 term	 denotes	 the	 presence	 of	
intrinsic	 awareness	 which	 is	 pristone
cognition
	 as	 an	 uncultivated	 seed,	 said	 to	 abide	 atemporally	 in	 the	 mental
continua	 of	 all	 sentient	 beings.	 See

Natural	Purity
	
gnas-su	dag-pa/rnam-par	dag-pa
According	to	the	terminology	of	the	
Nyingma
	school	and	in	the	context	of	the
present	work,	the	term	‘natural	purity’	refers	to	the	quiescent	naturally	abiding
purity	of	the	psycho-physical	
aggregates
,	
elemental	properties
,	and	sensory
and	mental	processes	as	represented	by	the	forty-two	
peaceful	deities
	of	the
maṇḍala
.	‘Natural	purity’	indicates	the	presence	of	the	assembly	of	peaceful
deities	in	the	
continuum	of

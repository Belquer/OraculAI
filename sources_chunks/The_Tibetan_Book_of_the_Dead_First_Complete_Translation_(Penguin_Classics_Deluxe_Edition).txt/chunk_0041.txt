To	the	assembly	of	the	Peaceful	and	Wrathful	deities,
And	to	the	assembly	of	the	Hundred	Sacred	Enlightened	Families!
Having	been	liberated	in	the	intermediate	states,
May	all	beings	abide	in	the	reality	of	the	three	buddha-bodies.
	
O	You	who	are	fortunate	and	auspiciously	blessed,
Apply	[yourself	to]	the	meditations	and	recitations	of	this	most	lucid	Spiritual
Practice,
Which	is	a	coalescence	of	the	[full	means	of	accomplishment]	of	the	Peaceful
and	Wrathful	Deities!
Never	forget	[to	practise	this]	throughout	the	three	times.
THE	TEN-BRANCHED	PRAYER	FOR	THE	ACCUMULATION
[OF	MERIT]
[First],	visualise	in	the	space	before	you	the	Three	Precious	Jewels	and	the
deities	of	the	hundred	enlightened	families,	and	then	recite	as	follows:
	
The	Branch	of	Taking	Refuge
OṂ	ĀḤ	HŪṂ
I	respectfully	take	refuge,	inseparably,	from	now	until	enlightenment,
In	the	infinitude	of	Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities,	the	Conquerors	Gone	to
Bliss,
The	Three	Precious	Jewels,	the	meditational	deities,
The	ocean	of	ḍākin
ῑ
s,	and	assembly	of	oath-bound	protectors,
Within	the	infinite	[buddha]	fields,	reaching	to	the	limits	of	space.
	
The	Branch	of	Invitation
I	request	the	infinite	Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities
Of	the	ten	directions	and	four	times,
Compassionate	emanations	embodying	discriminative	awareness	and	skilful

means,
Pervading	the	vast	infinite	space	of	reality’s	expanse,
To	come	to	this	place	for	the	sake	of	[all]	living	beings.
	
The	Branch	of	Requesting	[the	Deities]	to	be	Seated
I	request	that	[the	meditational	deities]	be	seated,
Here	on	sun,	moon,	and	lotus	cushions,
[Symbolising]	 skilful	 means,	 discriminative	 awareness,	 and	 their	 stainless
[union],
Upon	their	bejewelled	thrones	[fashioned]	in	the	form	of	lions	and	so	forth,
In	[an	attitude	of]	unblemished	supreme	delight,
Within	this	maṇḍala	of	pristine	cognition,
Which	is	the	[natural]	purity	of	phenomenal	existence!
	
The	Branch	of	Paying	Homage
I	bow	down	to	the	assembly	of	the	Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Conquerors,
To	the	father	and	mother	deities,	and	[all]	their	offspring,
[Whose	essence	is]	the	pristine	cognition	of	Samantabhadra,
Displayed	as	uncorrupted	bliss	in	the	secret	womb	of	Samantabhadr
ῑ
.
	
The	Branch	of	Making	Offerings
I	request	the	Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Conquerors,	the	oceans	of	Those	Gone	to
Bliss,
To	partake	of	these	inestimable	outer,	inner,	and	secret	offerings,
Both	those	actually	arrayed	and	those	mentally	emanated,
Which	are	offered	for	the	benefit	of	all	living	beings.
	
The	Branch	of	the	Confession	of	Negativity
I	acknowledge	and	remorsefully	confess	all	my	negative	obscurations
And	all	my	habitual	tendencies	of	body,	speech	and	mind,
Beginninglessly	influenced	by	the	three	poisons
Which	are	the	accumulating	causes	for	[rebirth]
Among	the	lower	states	[of	suffering]	in	cyclic	existence.
	
The	Branch	of	Sympathetic	Rejoicing
I	rejoice	with	great	delight	in	the	[buddha]	fields	of	supreme	bliss,

Where	all	phenomenal	existence	is	[recognised	as]	the	pervasion	of	reality’s
expanse.
I	rejoice	in	[all]	compassionate	acts,	in	their	merits,	and	in	their	altruistic
intention,
And	in	all	[deeds	that	are]	the	source	of	merit	and	pristine	cognition.
	
The	Branch	of	Turning	the	Wheel	of	the	[Sacred]	Teachings
I	exhort	the	teachers	throughout	the	fields	of	the	ten	directions,
Who	are	as	numerous	as	atoms,
To	stir	from	their	meditative	commitments	for	the	sake	of	all	sentient	beings,
And	to	turn	the	Wheel	of	the	Sacred	Teachings,
Thus	[entirely]	pervading	the	reaches	of	space.
	
The	Branch	of	Requesting	[the	Buddhas]	Not	to	Enter	Nirvāṇa
I	beseech	you	all,	O	teachers,	infinite	buddhas	without	exception,
To	remain	[present]	and	not	to	pass	into	nirvāṇa,
And	to	continue	to	enact	deeds	of	extensive	benefit	for	the	sake	of	beings,
Until	the	world-systems

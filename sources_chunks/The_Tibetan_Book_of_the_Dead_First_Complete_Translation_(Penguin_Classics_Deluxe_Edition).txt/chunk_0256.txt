as	an	eminent	historical	figure,	a	
bodhisattva
	who	was	one	of	the	eight	principal
bodhisattva
	
disciples	of	
Sākyamuni	Buddha
.	It	is	to	him	that	the	
Five	Works
	of
Maitreya
	
(
Byams-chos	sde-lnga
)	are	attributed.	According	to	the	classical	
sūtra
literature	it	is	the	
bodhisattva
	Maitreya
	who	is	the	coming	
buddha
,	fifth	in	the
line	of	one	thousand	
buddhas
	(
Sākyamuni
	being	the	fourth)	who	will	descend
to	this	world	during	the	
aspicious	aeon
.	Currently	he	is	said	to	be	residing	in	the
god
	realm	of	
Tuṣita
.	He	is	also	one	of	the	four	outer	male	
bodhisattvas
	among
the	forty-two	
peaceful	deities
.	See	Appendix	Two.

The	
Buddha-body	of	Supreme	Emanation
	is	characterised	by	thirty-two	major
marks	 (Skt.	
dvātriṃ
śan-mahāpuruṣalaks
aṇa
)	 and	 eighty	 minor	 marks	 (Skt.
as
ῑ
tyanuvyañjana
),	 which	 are	 all	 enumerated	 in	
Maitreya
’s	
Ornament	 of
Emergent	 Realisation
	 (
Abhisamayālaṃkāra
,	 T	 3786,	 vv.	 13-17	 and	 21-32).
These	 include	 an	 array	 of	 perfected	 features	 of	 body	 and	 speech,	 which
according	to	the	commentaries	are	the	specific	results	of	diverse	aspects	of	a
buddha
’s	conduct.
	
Malevolent/Beguiling	Forces
	
bdud
,	Skt.	
māra
Buddhist	literature	speaks	of	four	kinds	of	beguiling	influences	which	are	the
obstacles	that	impede	one’s	spiritual	transformation.	These	are	the	influence	of:
our	impure	psycho-physical	
aggregates
	(
skandha
);	our	
dissonant	mentalstates
(
kleśa
);	deva’s	son	(
devaputra
),	which	refers	to	sensual	desires	and	temptations;
and	the	lord	of	death	(
mṛtyupati
),	which	refers	to	ordinary	death,	at	the	point	of
which	 rebirth	 in	 cyclic	 existence	 continues	 rather	 than	 the	 attainment	 of
buddhahood
.	As	recorded	in	the	life	of	
Śākyamuni	Buddha
,	these	archetypal
forces	projected	images	of	desire	and	terror	which	were	designed	to	interrupt	his
mediative	 equipoise
,	 just	 prior	 to	 his	 attainment	 of	 manifestly	 perfect
buddhahood
	at	
Bodhgaya
	in	India.
	
Maṇḍala
	
dkyil-‘khor
The	Sanskrit	word	‘
maṇḍala
’	conveys	a	number	of	meanings	-	circle,	wheel,
circumference,	totality,	assembly	or	literary	corpus.	In	the	context	of	
Anuyoga
and	
Atiyoga
,	the	expression	‘three	
maṇḍalas
’	specifically	refers	to	the	scope	of
buddha-body
,	
speech
	and	
mind
.	Then,	in	a	more	general	usage,	this	term
indicates	the	central	(
dkyil
)	and	peripheral	(
’khor
)	deities	described	in	the	
tantra
texts.	These	deities	reside	within	a	celestial	palace	(
vimāṇa
),	which	generally	has
a	 perfectly	 symmetrical	 design	 -	 with	 four	 gateways	 and	 four	 main	 walls
composed	of	five	layers	of	different	colours,	each	of	the	features	corresponding
to	a	particular	aspect	of	the	principal	deity’s,	and	thereby	to	the	meditator’s,	pure
awareness
	and	purity	of	perception.	
The	
maṇḍala
	thus	represents	a	perfected
state	of	being	and	perception	encompassing	all	phenomena.	The	celestial	palace
itself	and	the	deities	within	it	symbolise	the	perfected	states	of	the	meditator’s
own	
awareness
,	psycho-physical	
aggregates
,	elemental	properties,	sensory	and
mental	processes,	
etc.
	When	such	
maṇḍalas
	are	represented	symbolically,	they

may	take	the	form	of	a	two-dimensional	image	on	painted	cloth,	or	they	may	be
made	of	coloured	sand,	or	else	constructed	as	a	three-dimensional	structure,
carved	from	wood	or	other	materials.	The	visualisation	of	
maṇḍalas
	in	their
three-dimensional	 form	 plays	 a	 crucial	 role	 in	 the	
generation	 stage
	 of
meditation.	 Here,	 these	 ‘abodes	 of	 the	 deity’	 are	 never	 perceived	 of	 as
independently	existing	universes	but	as	manifestations	of	the	
pristine	cognition
of	the	principal	
meditational	deity
	being	meditated	upon.	The	symbolism	of	the
maṇḍala
	of	forty-two	
peaceful	deities
	and	fifty-eight	
wrathful	deities
,	as	it
relates	to	our	text,	is	given	in	Appendix	Two.

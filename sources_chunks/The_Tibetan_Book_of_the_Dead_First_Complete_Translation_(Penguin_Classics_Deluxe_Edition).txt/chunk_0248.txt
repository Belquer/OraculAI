thout	change,	and
the	process	of	change	is	dynamic	and	never	ending,	reflecting	the	nature	of	flux
and	fluidity	in	conditioned	existence.	This	fundamental	quality	of	impermanence
extends	to	both	the	external	world	and	the	perceiving	
mind
.
	
Imperecatory	Female	Spirits
	
ma-mo
,	Skt.	
mātaraḥ
	
The	imprecatory	female
spirits	are	generally	depicted	as	ugly,	ferocious,	dark-complexioned,	and	half-
naked	 with	 emaciated	 breasts	 and	 matted	 hair.	 They	 invoke	 curses	 and
imprecations,	 inflicting	 plague	 (
dal-yams
)	 on	 living	 beings.	 The	 mundane
imprecatory	female	spirits	of	Tibet	were	subdued	by	
Padmasambhava
	on	Mount
Chuwori
,	while	the	supramundane	category	includes	the	protectress	
Sr
ῑ
dev
ῑ
	(Tib.
dpal-ldan	lha-mo
)	in	the	form	Remat
ῑ
,	and	the	eight	
mātarah
	(
ma-mo	brgyad
)
headed	by	
Gaur
ῑ
,	who	form	one	subcategory	of	the	fifty-eight	
wrathful	deities
.
See	Appendix	Two.	One	of	the	eight	principal	
meditational	deities
	 of	 the
Mahāyoga
	
sādhana
	 class	 is	 known	 as	 Imprecatory	
Mātaraḥ
	(
ma-mo	 rbod-
gtong
).
	
Incalculable	Aeon
	
grangs-med	bskal-pa
,	Skt.	
asaṃkhyeyakalpa

The	expression	incalculable	aeon	indicates	a	period	of	time	equivalent	to	10	to
the	power	of	59	lesser	
aeons
.
	
Indestructible	Chains	of	Inner	Radiance
	
’od-gsal	rdo-rje	lu-gu-rgyud
The	 appearance	 of	 indestructible	 chains	 of	 light	 or	
inner	 radiance
	 occurs
through	the	meditative	technique	known	as	
All-surpassing	Realisation
	(
thod-
rgal
	),	according	to	the	
Great	Perfection
	(
rdzogs-pa	chen-po
).	The	arising	of
these	chains	of	light	is	an	indication	of	the	
natural	expression
	(
rang-bzhin
)	of
intrinsic	awareness
	(
rang-rig
),	through	which	the	
Buddha-body	of	Perfect
Resource
	becomes	manifest.
	
Indestructible	Cross-legged	Posture
	
rdo-rje’i	skyil-krung
,	Skt.	
vajrāsana
Contrasted	 with	 the	 ‘lotus	 posture’	 (Skt.	
padmāsana
),	 this	 ‘indestructible
posture’	is	formed	by	crossing	the	legs	with	the	feet	upturned	and	folded	along
the	thighs.	In	the	case	of	the	indestructible	posture	the	right	leg	is	folded	above
the	left,	whereas	in	the	lotus	position	the	left	leg	is	folded	over	the	right.	This	is
one	of	the	optimum	recommended	meditation	postures,	included	in	the	
Seven-
point	Posture	of
	
Vairocana
	
.
	
Indestructible	Expanse
	
rdo-rje’i	dbyings
,	Skt.	
vajradhātu
Generally	 a	 synonym	 for	 the	
expanse	 of	 reality
	 (Skt.	
dharmadhātu
)	 or
emptiness
.	In	certain	contexts	it	also	refers	to	the	name	of	the	central	figures	of
the	
Vajradhātu	
maṇḍala
	of	the	
Yogatantras
.
	
Indestructible	Hell
	
rdo-rje	dmyal-ba
,	Skt.	
vajranaraka
A	synonym	for	the	hell	of	ultimate	torment	(Skt.	
Av
ῑ
ci
),	which	relates	to	the
admonition	that	those	who	violate	their	
commitments
	in	respect	of	the	
Vehicle
of	Indestructible	Reaity
	are	reborn	there.	See	
Eighteen	Hells
.
	
Indestructible	Reality
	
rdo-rje,
	Skt.	
vajra
The	 fully	 enlightened	
buddha-body
,	
speech
	 and	
mind
	 are	 described	 as
indestructible	reality.	This	suggests	that	the	fruitional	attributes	of	
buddhahood
are	 adamantine	 and	 indivisible,	 for	 they	 are	 invulnerable	 to	 all	 degrees	 of
physical,	verbal	and	mental	defilement.

Inherent	Existence
	
rang-ngo-bo-nyid
,	Skt.	
svabhāvatā
The	term	‘inherent	existence’	refers	to	the	ontological	status	of	phenomena,
according	to	which	phenomena	are	attributed	with	existence	in	their	own	right,
inherently,	in	and	of	themselves,	objectively,	and	independent	of	any	other
phenomena	such	as	our	conception	and	labelling.	The	
Madhyamaka
	schools	of
thought	refute	such	a	nature	of	existence	and	argue	that	nothing	exists	inherently,
for	nothing	can	be	found	to	exist	independently	from	conceptuality	and	labelling
when	scrutinised	through	an	ultimate	analysis.	The	
Madhyamaka
	schools	hold
that	things	exist	only	conventionally	and	their	existence	can	be	validated	only
within	 a	 relative	 framework	 of	 conventional

The	
vows
	maintained	by	Buddhist	monks	and	nuns	include	the	avoidance	of
primary	 downfalls	 (Skt.	
āpatti
)	 and	 secondary	 transgressions.	 The	 term
transgression	(
nyes-byas
	
)	is	used	in	a	technical	sense	to	refer	to	a	whole	host	of
secondary	precepts	in	the	context	of	the	
monastic	vows
	of	individual	liberation
(
prātimokṣa
),	and	in	the	context	of	the	
bodhisattva
	and	tantric	vows.	The	list	of
these	 transgressions	 differs	 according	 to	 the	 context.	 See

Transmission
	
lung
,	Skt

The	Buddhist	
sacred	teachings
	(
Skt.	saddharma
)	comprise	both	experiential
realisations
	
(
adhigama
;	 Tib.	
rtogs-pa
)	 and	 authoritative	 transmissions.	 The
latter	include	both	the	oral	teachings	and	sacred	scriptures	(Skt.	
pravacana
,	Tib.
gsung-rab
),	imparted	by	the	
buddhas
,	as	well	as	the	associated	commentaries	or
treatises
	 (Skt.	
śāstra
,	 Tib.	
bstan-bcos
),	 which	 have	 been	 transmitted	 in	 an
uninterrupted	
lineage
	
or	succession	from	ancient	times.	In	Tibetan	Buddhism,	it
is	 regarded	 as	 essential	 that	 a	 transmission	 of	 both	 the	 text	 and	 its	 oral
commentary	is	formally	received	from	an	authoritative	
lineage	holder
,	if	any
significant	 spiritual	 experience	 is	 to	 be	 cultivated,	 since	 a	 mere	 theoretical
understanding	of	these	topics	is	not	regarded	as	sufficient.
	
Transmitted	Precepts

From	the	perspective	of	the	
Nyingma
	school,	the	scriptures	and	oral	teachings	of
Buddhism	have	been	transmitted	in	two	distinct	ways:	through	the	long	oral
lineage	of	transmitted	precepts	(
ring-brgyud	bka’-ma
),	which	have	been	handed
down	from	one	generation	of	accomplished	teachers	to	the	next	since	ancient
times,	and	through	a	close	lineage	of	revealed	teachings	or	
treasures
	(
nye-
brgyud	gter-ma
),	whose	origin	is	more	recent.
	
Treasure-finder

accomplished	master

	who	successfully	reveals
a	hidden	
treasure

by	
Padmasambhava
	 or	 a	 specific	 concealer	 of

Treasures
	
gter-ma
,	Skt.	
nidhi
The	Sanskrit	
nidhi
	(Tib.	
gter-ma
),	translated	in	English	as	‘treasure’	or	‘revealed
teaching’	(
gter-chos
),	refers	to	those	sacred	Buddhist	texts	and	objects	which

were	concealed	in	the	past	in	order	that	they	might	be	protected	and	revealed	in
the	future	for	the	benefit	of	posterity.	The	notion	of	the	revelation	of	concealed
texts	 as	 treasure	 is	 extremely	 ancient	 in	 India	 and	 China.	 Within	 Indian
Buddhism,	it	is	well	known	that	the	
Perfection	of	Discriminative	Awareness
(
Prajñāpāramitā
)	
sūtras
	
were	 reputedly	 revealed	 when	
Nāgārjuna
	 received
them	in	the	form	of	treasure	from	the	
serpentine	water	spirits
	(
nāga
).	 A
recension	of	the	
sādhana
	class	of	
Mahāyoga	tantras
,	classified	as	
gter-chos
	by
Nyingma
	doxographers,	is	also	said	to	have	been	revealed	to	eight	great	masters,
including	
Nāgārjuna
,	in	the	
Ś
ῑ
tavana
	charnel	ground	near	
Vajrāsana
.	In	Tibet,
the	 tradition	 of	 the	 treasures	 was	 introduced	 by	
Padmasambhava
	 and	 his
students,	who	concealed	texts	and	sacred	objects	at	geomantic	power-places	in
the	landscape,	entrusting	them	to	their	respective	custodians	or	treasure-lords
(
gter-bdag
)	or	to	
ḍākin
ῑ
	for	safe	keeping,	with	the	prediction	that	these	would	be
discovered	at	some	future	time	by	a	prophesied	
treasure-finder
	(
gter-ston
).
Accordingly,	it	is	believed	that	the	students	of	
Padmasambhava
	
have	continued
to	emanate	in	the	form	of	
treasure-finders
	in	successi

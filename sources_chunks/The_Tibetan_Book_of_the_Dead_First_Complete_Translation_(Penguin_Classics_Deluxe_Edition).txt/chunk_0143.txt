ion.	[Abiding]	in	this	state,	birth	will	be	obstructed
and	buddhahood	will	be	attained.
	
Yet,	those	unfamiliar	with	meditative	experience	and	those	very	weak	in	their
practice	will	not	be	able	to	understand	[and	apply	the	above	introductions].	Once
again,	overcome	by	confusion,	they	will	wander	towards	the	womb	entrances.
Thus,	 the	 teachings	 which	 obstruct	 the	 womb	 entrances	 become	 of	 great
importance	and	you	should,	once	again,	call	to	the	deceased	by	name	and	say	the
following	words:
	
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	if	you	have	not	attained	recognition	[as	a	result	of
the	introductions]	which	have	gone	before,	then,	based	on	the	potency	of	your
past	actions,	the	perception	will	arise	that	you	are	moving	upwards,	or	moving
horizontally	or	moving	downwards.
21
	
As	this	occurs,	you	should	meditate	on
Mahākaruṇika.	Remember	this!
Yet	again,	as	described	before,	the	experience	will	arise	of	being	pursued	by
whirlwinds,	blizzards,	hail,	or	fog;	and	a	crowd	of	people,	and	you	will	be	trying
to	escape.	Those	who	are	lacking	in	merit	will	experience	that	they	are	fleeing
towards	a	place	of	suffering.	Those	with	merit	will	experience	arriving	at	a	place
of	happiness.	O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	now,	at	this	point,	the	signs	of	
the
environment	into	which	you	are	to	be	born,	on	one	amongst	the	four	continents,
will	arise.	Specifically	for	this	moment,	there	are	many	profound	essential	points

of	 oral	 instruction.	 Therefore	 listen,	 now,	 without	 distraction.	 Even	 though,
previously,	you	have	not	taken	to	heart	the	essential	instructions	introduced	to
you,	 you	 can	 do	 so	 now,	 for	 even	 those	 whose	 practice	 is	 very	 weak	 can
understand	[and	apply	one	of]	the	following	essential	instructions.	So	listen,
now,	without	distraction.
At	this	stage,	it	is	extremely	important	that	you	carefully	employ	the	methods
for	obstructing	the	womb	entrances.	[Principally],	there	are	two	such	methods	of
obstruction.	These	are:	[first],	the	method	which	obstructs	the	person	who	is	to
enter	the	womb	and,	[second],	the	methods	which	obstruct	the	womb	which	is	to
be	entered.
	
The	oral	teaching	for	the	method	which	obstructs	the	person	who	is	to	enter	the
womb,	is	as	follows:
	
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,
	(call	to	the	deceased	by	name)	
visualise	now	your
meditational	deity,	whichever	it	may	be,	with	vibrancy.	[Meditate	on	the	deity]
as	[vividly]	apparent,	yet	completely	lacking	in	inherent	existence,	like	[the
reflection	of]	the	moon	in	water.	If	you	do	not	have	a	specific	meditational	deity,
then	 visualise	 the	 lord	 Mahākāruṇika,	 again	 with	 great	 vibrancy.	 Then,
[gradually],	dissolve	[the	image	of]	the	meditational	deity	from	the	extremities
[inwards,	until	it	disappears	completely]	and	then	meditate	on	the	[resultant
union]	of	inner	radiance	and	emptiness,	which	is	utterly	free	from	any	objective
referent.	This	is	the	profound	essential	point.	Meditate	in	this	way,	for	it	is	said
that	by	this	means	entry	into	a	womb	will	be	averted.
	
Should	even	this	[introduction]	not	cause	obstruction	and	should	[the	deceased]
continue	 to	 draw	 closer	 to	 the	 act	 of	 entering	 a	 womb,	 there	 are	 also	 the
profound	oral	instructions	which	obstruct	the	womb	entrances.	These	are	as
follows:
	
[O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,]	listen	[carefully]!	In	the	recitation	of	the
	Root
Verses	of	the	[Six]	Intermediate	States
,	the	following	lines	are	spoken.	Repeat
these,	now,	after	me:
22
Alas,	now	as	the	intermediate	state	of	rebirth	arises	before	me,
I	must	with	one-pointed	intention	concentrate	my	mind,
And	resolutely	connect	with	the	residual	potency	of	my	virtuous	past	actions.

I	must	obstruct	the	womb	entrances	and	call	to	mind	the	methods	of	reversal.
This	is	the	time	when	perseverance	and	purity	of	perception	are	imperative.
I	must	give	up	all	jealousy	and	meditate	on	my	spiritual	teacher	with	consort.
	
It	is	extremely	important	to	clearly	repeat	these	verses	aloud,	to	arouse	your
memories	[of	past	virtues],	to	meditate	on	this	[prayer]

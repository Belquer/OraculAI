and	 associated	 in	 some	 respects	 with	 the	
Yogācāra
tradition.	The	
Cittamātra
	(lit.	‘mind	only’)	school	founded	by	the	fourth-century
Indian	master	
Asaṅga
	propounds	an	idealist	or	phenomenalistic	view	of	the
world.	Its	main	tenet	is	that	all	phenomena	are	either	actual	mental	events	or
extensions	of	the	mind	and	the	mind	is	regarded	as	existing	as	a	substantially
real	entity.	In	addition,	the	school	propounds	that	there	exists	no	atomically
composed	 material	 world	 external	 to,	 or	 independent	 of,	 our	 perceptions.
According	to	the	
Cittamātra
	school	consciousness	itself	is	considered	to	be
eightfold,	 with	 the	
ground-of-all	 consciousness
	 as	 the	 foundation.	 See

during	 the	
perfection	 stage
	 (

Commitement
	
dam-tshig
,	Skt.	
samaya
A	sacred	commitment	or	pledge	taken	by	a	practitioner	which	is	a	prerequisite
for	the	practice	of	the	
tantras
.	The	Tibetan	‘
dam-tshig
’	literally	means	‘binding
word’,	indicating	that	the	person	becomes	bound	by	a	solemn	oath.	Each	class	of
tantra
	
has	its	own	categorisation	of	basic	and	ancillary	commitments,	which
complement	the	
prātimokṣa
	and	
bodhisattva
	
vows
	taken	by	those	who	uphold
the	
vinaya
	
and	the	
sūtra
	tradition	of	the	
Greater	Vehicule
	respectively.	See
Vows
.	
Samaya
	 may	 entail	 the	 observation	 of	 specific	 precepts	 which	 are
common	to	a	whole	class	of	
tantra
,	or	individual	precepts,	which	must	be
observed	in	relation	to	a	particular	
meditational	deity
.	When	such	commitments
are	broken	they	must	be	restored	through	appropriate	tantric	ritual	practices,	for
their	degeneration	may	cause	serious	hindrances	to	progress	on	the	path.	See
Chapter	7.

Compassion
	
snying-rje/thugs-rje
,	Skt.	
karunā
In	Buddhist	literature,	the	term	‘compassion’	is	often	used	as	a	synonym	for
‘great	compassion’	(
mahākarunā
),	which	refers	to	a	totally	unbiased	mind	that
aspires	 to	 the	
liberation
	 of	 all	
sentient	 beings
	 from	 suffering,	 equally.
Compassion	is	said	to	become	‘great’	only	when,	through	proper	training	of	the
mind
,	such	an	altruistic	aspiration	becomes	spontaneous	and	no	longer	requires
any	conscious	effort	for	its	arising.	The	measure	of	having	realised	such	a	state	is
that	one	spontaneously	feels	a	sense	of	intimacy	and	compassion	towards	all

others,	with	the	same	degree	of	commitment	and	intensity	that	one	feels	towards
one’s	most	beloved.	It	is	worth	bearing	in	mind	that	in	Buddhism,	compassion
should	 not	 be	 understood	 in	 terms	 of	 pity,	 which	 may	 imply	 a	 feeling	 of
superiority	toward	the	object	of	compassion.

Refuge
	
skyabs-’gro
,	Skt.	
śaraṇagamana
This	term	in	Buddhist	usage	indicates	the	act	of	entrusting	one’s	spiritual	growth
and	well-being	to	the	
Three	Precious	Jewels
.	The	
Three	Precious	Jewels
	are
the	
objects	of	refuge,	and	the	nature	of	the	refuge	sought	from	each	of	the	three
differs.	In	the	
Buddha
,	the	fully	
enlightened
	teacher,	guidance	on	a	correct	path
to	
buddahood
	is	sought;	in	the	
sacred	teachings
,	the	
realisations
	of	the	path
are	 sought;	 and	 in	 the	
monastic/supreme	 community
	 (
saṅgha
)	 perfect
companionship	on	the	path	to	
buddhahood
	is	sought.	The	successful	taking	of
refuge	in	the	
Three	Precious	Jewels
	requires	the	following	two	conditions:	a)	a
genuine	anxiety	in	the	face	of	the	potential	for	future	
suffering
	and	b)	a	genuine
confidence	in	the	capacity	of	the	
Three	Precious	Jewels
	to	offer	protection	from
these	potential	
sufferings
.	In	the	context	of	our	text,	the	act	of	going	for	refuge
constitutes	the	first	of	the	five	uncommon	
preliminary	practices
	(
thun-min
sngon-’gro
).	Here,	the	three	levels	of	refuge	are	recognised:	the	outer	refuge
(phyi’i	skyabs-’gro
),	which	is	taken	in	the	
Buddha
,	the	
sacred	teachings
	and	the
monastic	community
;	the	inner	refuge	(
nang-gi	skyabs-’gro
),	which	is	taken	in
the	
spiritual	teacher
,	the	
meditational	deity
	and	the	
ḍākin
ῑ
	and	the	secret
refuge	(
gsang-ba’i	skyabs-’gro
),	which	is	taken	in	the	
Buddha-body	of	Reality
,

the	
Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource
	and	the	
Buddha-body	of	Emanation

Renunciation
	
nges-’byung/spang-ba,
	Skt.	
naiṣkramya/prahāṇa
The	English	term	renunciation	translates	both	the	Tibetan	terms	
nges-’byung
	and
spang-ba
.	In	the	former	sense,	renunciation	refers	to	
Sākyamuni	Buddha
’s
renunciation	of	the	household	life	and	it	is	defined	as	a	mental	attitude	free	from
impulsive	clinging	to	all	worldly	attributes	such	as	wealth,	fame,	position	and
the	thought	of	a	favourable	rebirth	in	a	future	life.	It	is	only	on	the	basis	of	such
an	attitude	that	the	practitioner	can	spontaneously	generate	a	genuine	wish	to	be
free	from	
cyclic	existence
.	Hence	the	real	meaning	of	renunciation	lies	not	just
in	mere	physical	separation	from	objects	of	desire	but	more	importantly	in	a
quality	of	mental	
liberation
	which	is	free	from	even	the	slightest	degree	of
craving	for	mundane	values.	The	Tibetan	word	
nges-’byung
	literally	means	a
‘definite	emergence’,	indicating	a	definite	emergence	from	the	bonds	of	our
normally	narrow-minded	attachment	to	worldly	pleasures.	In	the	latter	sense
(Skt.	
prahāṇa
),	 renunciation	 refers	 to	 the	 four	 correct	 trainings	 which	 are
included	 among	 the	 thirty-seven	 aspects	 of	 the	 path	 to	 enlightenment
(
bodhipakṣikadharma
)	cultivated	by	those	aspiring	to	enlightenment,	namely:	1)
to	not	develop	
non-virtuous	actions
	which	have	not	arisen,	2)	to	renounce	non-
virtuous	actions	which	have	arisen,	3)	to	develop	
virtuous	actions
	which	have
not	arisen,	and	4)	to	not	renounce	virtuous	actions	which	have	arisen.
	
Rinpoche
	
rin-po-che
This	term	literally	means	‘high	in	value	or	esteem’,	and	in	ordinary	language
indicates	a	precious	jewel.	By	extension,	in	Tibetan	Buddhism,	the	term	has
come	to	refer	to	an	incarnate	master	who	is	‘high	in	value’	or	‘most	precious’.
Accordingly,	the	title	‘
Rinpoche
’	is	widely	used	by	Tibetans	to	refer	to	any
incarnate	
spiritual	teacher
.	See

nces,	this	[array]	will	come	to	escort	those	who	have
kept	their	commitments	and	to	bring	to	account	those	who	have	allowed	their
commitments	to	degenerate.
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	a	five-coloured	light,	which	is	[indicative	of]	the
purity	of	your	habitual	tendencies	in	the	expanse	[of	reality]	and	of	coemergent
pristine	cognition,	composed	of	
coloured	threads	[of	light]	twisted	together,
pulsing,	 shimmering,	 translucent,	 radiant,	 clear,	 bright	 and	 awesome,	 [will
emanate]	from	the	hearts	of	the	five	principal	awareness	holders	and	will	shine
piercingly	before	you,	at	the	level	of	your	heart	[with	such	brilliance]	that	your
eyes	cannot	bear	it.	At	that	moment,	a	dull	green	light,	[indicative	of]	the	realms
of	the	animals,	will	arise	simultaneously	with	the	light	of	pristine	cognition	[and
touch	your	heart].	At	this	time,	bewildered	and	confused	by	your	past	habitual
tendencies,	you	will	be	frightened	by	the	five-coloured	light,	and	wish	to	turn
away.	Instantly,	you	will	be	attracted	to	the	dull	light	of	the	animal	realms,	so
therefore,	do	not	be	frightened	now	by	the	bright	and	flashing	five-coloured
light!	Do	not	be	terrified!	Recognise	this	[radiance]	to	be	pristine	cognition!
Within	the	[five-coloured]	light,	all	the	natural	sounds	of	the	sacred	teachings
will	resound	like	a	thousand	simultaneous	peals	of	thunder.	They	will	resound
like	a	[violent]	echo,	an	overwhelming	reverberation,	a	tumultuous	crescendo,	a
cacophony	of	war	cries,	and	[pound	with	the	roar	of]	wrathful	mantras	of
terrifying	ferocity.	Do	not	be	afraid!	Do	not	turn	away!	Recognise	these	sounds
and	luminosities	to	be	the	naturally	expressive	power	of	your	own	awareness,
manifesting	naturally.	Do	not	be	attracted	to	the	dull	green	light	of	the	animals.
Do	not	cling	to	it!	If	you	become	attached	to	it,	you	will	fall	into	the	obscured
realms	of	the	animals	and	be	enveloped	by	the	limitless	sufferings	of	obfuscation,
dumbness	and	servility,	from	which	there	will	be	no	[immediate]	opportunity	for
release.	So	do	not	be	attached	to	that	[dull	green	light]!	Be	devoted	to	the	five-
coloured	light	that	is	radiant	and	dazzling!	Focus	intently	and	one-pointedly	on
the	 divine	 assembly	 of	 the	 awareness	 holders,	 the	 transcendent	 lords	 and
spiritual	teachers,	thinking:	‘As	you,	the	Awareness	Holders	together	with	your
[attending]	heroes	and	ḍākin
ῑ
s	have	come	forward	to	escort	me	to	the	pure	realm
of	the	sky-farers,	I	implore	you,	pity	sentient	beings	such	as	myself	who	have
failed	to	amass	the	accumulations	[of	merit	and	pristine	cognition],	and	pity
those	such	as	I,	who	have	not	been	rescued	until	now,	even	though	we	have	been
embraced	by	the	compassion	of	all	the	assembled	deities	of	the	five	enlightened

families,	Those	Gone	to	Bliss,	throughout	the	three	times!	Today	may	you,	the
divine	assembly	of	awareness	holders,	not	allow	me	to	descend	any	further	than
this.	Grasp	me	with	the	hook	of	your	compassion,	
and	lead	me	immediately	to
the	pure	realm	of	the	sky-farers.’	Focusing	intently	and	one-pointedly	on	the
divine	[maṇḍala	of]	awareness	holders,	recite	the	following	aspirational	prayer:
	
O,	as	I	roam	in	cyclic	existence	[driven]	by	deep-seated	habitual	tendencies,
May	the	divine	assembly	of	awareness	holders	attend	to	me
And	lead	me	on	the	path,	with	great	love.
May	 the	 assembly	 of	 spiritual	 heroes	 and	 awareness	 holders	 draw	 me
forward,
Leading	me	on	the	path	of	radiant	light,
Which	is	[the	luminance	of]	coemergent	pristine	cognition.
May	the	supreme	consorts,	the	hosts	of	ḍākin
ῑ
s,	support	me	from	behind,
And,	thus	[encircled],	may	I	be	rescued
From	the	fearsome	passageway	of	the	intermediate	state,
And	be	escorted	to	the	[sacred]	pure	realm	of	the	sky-farers.
	
By	making	this	aspirational	prayer	with	fervent	devotion,	you	will	dissolve	into
rainbow	light,	in	the	heart	of	the	divine	assembly	of	the	awareness	holders,	and
thereafter,	undoubtedly,	be	born	into	the	pure-realm	of	the	sky-farers.
	
All	types	of	spiritual	friend	can	attai

Dependent	Origination

The	doctrine	of	dependent	origination	can	be	said	to	be	the	most	fundamental
metaphysical	view	of	Buddhist	thought	and	it	is	intimately	linked	with	the
Buddhist	notion	of	causation.	The	principle	of	dependent	origination	asserts	that
nothing	exists	independently	of	other	factors,	the	reason	for	this	being	that	things
and	 events	 come	 into	 existence	 only	 by	 dependence	 on	 the	 aggregation	 of
multiple	causes	and	conditions.	In	general,	the	processes	of	
cyclic	existence
,
through	which	the	external	world	and	the	
sentient	beings
	within	it	revolve	in	a
continuous	cycle	of	
suffering
,	propelled	by	the	
propensities
	of	
past	actions
	and
their	interaction	with	
dissonant	mental	states
,	are	said	to	originate	dependent
on	twelve	successive	links,	which	are	known	as	the	
twelve	links	of	dependent
origination	(
dvādaśāṅga-prat
ῑ
tyasamutpāda
	
).	These	comprise:	1)	
fundamental
ignorance
,	2)	
motivational	tendencies
,	3)	
consciousness
,	4)	name	and	form,	5)
sensory	activity	fields
,	6)	contact,	7)	
sensation
	
,	8)	
attachment
,	9)	grasping,
10)	rebirth	process,	11)	birth,	12)	ageing	and	death.	Although,	in	the	ultimate
sense	there	is	no	beginning	to	the	continuum	of	
mind
,	a	relative	beginning	can
be	spoken	of	on	the	basis	of	a	single	instance	of	rebirth	within	
cyclic	existence
.
Every	instance	of	birth	in	
cyclic	existence
	must	have	a	cause	and	such	causes	are
ultimately	rooted	in	our	
fundamental	ignorance
,	which	misapprehends	the	true
nature	of	
actual	reality
.	For	an	ordinary	
sentient	being
	all	the	twelve	links	are
interconnected	and	each	component	of	the	chain	contributes	to	the	perpetuation
of	the	cycle.	It	is	only	through	deliberate	reversal	of	
fundamental	ignorance
that	one	can	succeed	in	bringing	the	whole	cycle	to	an	end.	
Fundamental
ignorane
	(
avidyā
)	gives	rise	to	conditioning	or	tendencies	(
saṃskāra
)	which	are
stored	 in	 the	 substratum	 or	
ground-of-all	 consciousness
	 (
ālayavijñāna
).
Following	the	moment	of	a	sentient	being’s	conception,	this	inheritance	of	past
actions	from	a	previous	life	gives	rise	to	name	and	form	(
nāmarūpa
),	
i.e.
	to	the
five	psycho-physical	
aggregates	(
pañcaskandha
),	which	are	products	of	that
dualising	consciousness.	Then,	the	sensory	activity	fields	(
āyatana
)	provide	the
subjective	and	objective	framework	for	sensory	activity	in	its	initial	stages	of
development;	 while	 contact	 (
sparśa
)	 refers	 to	 the	 maturation	 of	 sensory

perception	as	an	unborn	child	develops	a	sensitivity	to	its	environment	inside	the
womb.	Thereafter,	sensation	(
vedanā
),	
attachment
	(
tṛṣṇā
),	grasping	(
ādāna
),
rebirth	process	(
bhava
),	and	actual	birth	(	
jāti
)	
together	indicate	the	emergence
of	a	
sentient	being
	within	the	living	world;	and	these	in	turn	lead	inevitably	to
old	age	and	death	(
jarāmaraṇa
).

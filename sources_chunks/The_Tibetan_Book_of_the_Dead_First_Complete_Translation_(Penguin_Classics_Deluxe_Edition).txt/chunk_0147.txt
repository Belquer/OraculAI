in	the	same	way,	for	example,	as	water	is
poured	into	water.	Let	[the	mind]	rest	in	its	natural	flow,	clear,	unconstricted,
uncontrived	and	relaxed.

[By	following	this	method]	
you	can	be	sure	that	the
womb	entrances	to	the	four	modes	of	birth	will	certainly	be	obstructed.	Meditate
again	and	again	in	this	way,	until	the	womb	entrances	are	closed.
	
Set	down	above	are	several	profound	and	genuine	instructions	for	effecting	the
obstruction	of	the	womb	entrances.	For	those	with	high,	average	or	low	ability,	it
is	impossible	not	to	be	liberated	by	these	[instructions].	This	is	because:	first,
consciousness	 in	 the	 intermediate	 state	 is	 endowed	 with	 an,	 albeit	 corrupt,
supernormal	cognitive	ability.	Therefore,	whatever	one	says	[to	the	deceased]	is
heard	by	the	deceased.	Second,	even	if	the	deceased	was	deaf	or	blind	[while	in
the	human	world],	now,	[in	the	intermediate	state],	all	the	sensory	faculties	will
be	complete	and	therefore	whatever	is	said	will	be	apprehended.	Third,	since	the
deceased	is	continuously	being	overwhelmed	by	fear	and	terror,	there	is	an
undistracted	concentration	on	what	to	do;	therefore,	what	is	said	will	be	listened
to.	Fourth,	since	the	consciousness	has	no	[physical]	support,	it	is	easy	to	guide
and	it	can	penetrate	to	the	essence	of	whatever	is	focused	upon.	[Additionally],
since	the	power	of	retention	is	now	many	times	clearer,	even	the	mentally	weak
will	have,	in	the	intermediate	state,	a	lucid	awareness,	by	virtue	of	their	past
actions.	Hence,	they	will	have	the	gift	of	knowing	how	to	meditate	on	that	which
is	taught	and	the	gift	[to	assimilate]	such	points	[of	instruction].	These	are	the
reasons	why	the	performance	of	rituals	on	behalf	of	the	dead	is	beneficial.

Indeed,	it	is	extremely	important	to	persevere	in	the	reading	aloud	of	this	
Great
Liberation	by	Hearing	in	the	Intermediate	States
	for	the	entire	forty-nine	days.
For	if	liberation	is	not	achieved	at	one	introduction,	it	can	be	achieved	at	another.
This	is	the	reason	why,	not	just	one,	but	many	introductions	should	be	given.
[CHOOSING	A	WOMB	ENTRANCE]
Then	again,	there	are	several	kinds	[of	persons]	who	do	not	achieve	liberation,
despite	having	received	the	above	introductions	and	having	been	taught	the
above	 visualisation	 techniques.	 This	 [lack	 of	 ability]	 comes	 about	 through
limited	familiarity	with	virtuous	past	actions,	extensive	primal	familiarity	with
non-virtuous	 past	 actions,	 and	 the	 potency	 and	 great	 force	 of	 negative
obscurations.
	
So,	 at	 this	 stage,	 if	 the	 womb	 entrances	 have	 still	 not	 been	 [successfully]
obstructed	[as	described]	above,	there	is	a	profound	oral	instruction	for	choosing
an	[appropriate]	womb	entrance,
34
	which	should	now	be	presented.	Again,	one
should	request	the	assistance	of	the	buddhas	and	bodhisattvas,	take	refuge	in	[the
Three	Precious	Jewels]	and	cultivate	an	altruistic	intention.	Then,	as	before,
calling	to	the	deceased	by	name,	three	times,	one	should	say	the	following
words:
	
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,
	(repeat	the	name	of	the	deceased),	
listen	[carefully].
Even	though	many	[authentic]	introductions	to	the	instructions	have	previously
been	given	to	you,	up	until	this	stage,	you	have	not	taken	these	to	heart.	Now,	if
you	have	been	unable	to	obstruct	the	womb	entrances,	the	time	has	actually
come	for	you	to	assume	a	body.	There	are	[not	just	one,	but]	several	different
kinds	of	profound	[and	genuine]	instructions	which	relate	to	your	choice	of	an
appropriate	womb	entrance.	So	comprehend	these	well.	Do	not	be	distracted.
[Listen]	without	distraction!	Understand,	and	maintain	a	firm	intention!
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	now,	[if	you	are	to	be	born	as	a	human]	the
indications	and	signs	which	relate	to	the	environment	into	which	you	may	be
born,	on	one	amongst	the	[four]	continents,	will	arise.	You	must	recognise	these
[indications]!	 Indeed,	 you	 must	 choose	 the	 continent	 based	 on	 [a	 careful
examination	of	these]	indications	of	the	environment	into

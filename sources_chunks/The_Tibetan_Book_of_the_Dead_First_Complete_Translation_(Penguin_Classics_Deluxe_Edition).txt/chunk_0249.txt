crutinised	through	an	ultimate	analysis.	The	
Madhyamaka
	schools	hold
that	things	exist	only	conventionally	and	their	existence	can	be	validated	only
within	 a	 relative	 framework	 of	 conventional	
reality
.	 Absence	 of	 such	 an
ontological	reality,	
i.e.
	the	absence	of	the	inherent	existence	of	all	phenomena,	is
defined	as	the	true	nature	of	
reality
,	
emptiness
,	by	the	
Madhyamaka
	schools
and	by	the	
tantras

Inner	Radiance
	
’od-gsal
,	Skt.	
prabhāsvara
Sometimes	also	translated	as	‘clear	light’,	the	Tibetan	term	
’od-gsal
,	which	has
been	rendered	here	as	‘inner	radiance’,	refers	in	the	context	of	the	
perfection
stage
	of	
meditation
	(Skt.	
sampannakrama
)	to	the	subtlest	level	of	mind,	
i.e.
	the
fundamental,	essential	nature	of	all	our	cognitive	events.	Though	ever	present
within	all	
sentient	beings
,	this	inner	radiance	becomes	manifest	only	when	the
gross	mind	has	ceased	to	function.	Such	a	dissolution	is	experienced	by	ordinary
beings,	naturally,	at	the	time	of	death,	but	it	can	also	be	experientially	cultivated
through	the	practices	of	
Unsurpassed
	
Yogatantra
.	A	fundamental	distinction	is
made	between	the	inner	radiance	of	the	ground	(
gzhi’i	’od-gsal
)	and	the	inner
radiance	of	the	path	(
lam-gyi	’od-gsal
).	The	former,	which	is	also	known	as	the
‘mother	inner	radiance’	(
’od-gsal	ma
),	occurs	naturally	at	the	time	of	death,
when	it	indicates	the	presence	of	the	
Buddha-body	of	Reality
	(
dharmakāya
),
but	which	may	not	be	accompanied	by	an	awareness	of	its	nature.	The	latter,
which	is	also	known	as	the	‘child	inner	radiance’	(
’od-gsal	bu
)	is	an	awareness
of	 the	 ultimate	 nature	 of	 mind	 cultivated	 by	 the	 meditator	 in	 life,	
i.e.
	the
realisation	of	the	nature	of	the	‘mother	inner	radiance’	as	it	is	developed	in
meditation.	
Buddhahood
	is	achieved	when	the	‘mother	inner	radiance’	and
‘child	 inner	 radiance’	 conjoin.	 See	 Chapters	 8,	 10	 and	 11.	 Chapter	 11,	 in
particular,	differentiates	three	successive	phases	of	inner	radiance	which	are
experienced	at	the	time	of	death	and	immediately	thereafter:	the	primary	inner
radiance	(
bar-do	dang-po	chos-nyid	’od-gsal
),	which	is	identified	with	the	inner

radiance	of	the	ground,	the	secondary	inner	radiance	(
bar-do	’od-gsal	gnyis-pa
),
which	is	identified	with	the	inner	radiance	of	the	path,	and	the	tertiary	inner
radiance	(
bar-do	’od-gsal	gsum-pa
),	which	is	identified	with	the	subsequent
arising	of	the	
Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities
	during	the	
intermediate	state	of
reality
	(
chos-nyid	bar-do
).

Intentional	Lineage	of	the	Conquerors
	
rgyal-ba	dgongs-pa’i	brgyud-pa
According	to	the	
Nyingma
	school,	the	Buddhist	teachings	are	said	to	have	been
transmitted	through	six	
lineages
	(
brgyud-pa	drug
).	Among	these,	the	first,	which
is	known	as	the	‘intentional	lineage	of	the	conquerors’,	refers	to	the	
enlightened
intention
	(
dgongs-pa
)	of	
Samantabhadra
,	which	confers	the	realisation	of	the
atemporal	
Buddha-body	of	Reality
,	as	a	blessing	upon	the	male	and	female
buddhas
	of	the	
Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource
.
	
Intermediate	State
	
bar-do
,	Skt.	
antarābhava
The	 original	 usage	 of	 the	 term	 within	 the	 literature	 of	 classical	 Buddhist
abhidharma
	
suggests	that	it	referred	exclusively	to	the	period	between	the	time
of	death	and	the	time	of	rebirth.	According	to	the	
Nyingma
	and	
Kagyu
	schools,
however,	the	term	‘intermediate	state’	refers	to	key	phases	of	life	and	death
identified	 as:	 the	
intermediate	 state	 of	 living
	 (
rang-bzhin	 bar-do
),	 the
intermediate	 state	 of	 meditative	 concentration
	
(
bsam-gtan	 bar-do
),	 the
intermediate	state	of	dreams
	(
rmi-lam	bar-do
),	the	
intermediate	state	of	the
time	of	death
	(
’chi-kha’i	bar-do
),	
the	intermediate	state	of	reality
	(
chos-nyid
bar-do
)	and	the	
intermediate	state	of	rebirth

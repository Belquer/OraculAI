The	point	is	that	all	the	inestimable	84,000	aspects	of	the	sacred	teachings,	the
nine	vehicles,	the	three	or	four	
piṭaka
,	and	so	forth,	depend	upon	the	
primary
understanding	of	intrinsic	awareness.	Cf.	
Laṅkāvatārasūtra
,	Ch.	2,	v.	202:	‘As
long	as	sentient	beings	manifest,	there	will	be	no	end	to	the	vehicles.	When	the
mind	becomes	transformed,	there	is	neither	vehicle	nor	mover.’

The	Tibetan	expression	
tshig	gsum
	(lit.	‘three	words’)	is	used	colloquially	to
mean	‘terse’	or	‘in	few	words’.	Two	alternative	readings	have	been	suggested:	1)
The	phrase	‘three	words’	could	refer	to	the	three	statements	given	on	pp.	4	1-2,
that	‘past	thoughts	are	traceless,	clear	and	empty’,	that	‘future	thoughts	are
unproduced	and	fresh’,	and	that	‘the	present	moment	abides	naturally	and
unconstructed’.	2)	A	less	likely	view	is	that	this	expression	may	refer	to	the
Atiyoga	testament	of	Prahevajra	(Tib.	dGa’-rab	rdo-rje),	entitled	
Three	Points
which	Penetrate	the	Essential
	(
tshig-gsum	gnad-du	brdeg-pa
).	The	three	points
contained	in	this	latter	work	crystalise	the	process	through	which	intrinsic
awareness	(
rang-rig
)	is	introduced.	They	are	as	follows:	the	‘direct	introduction

to	the	essence	itself’	(
ngo-rang	thog-tu	’phrod-pa
),	the	‘direct	determination	of
this	unique	state’	(
thag-gcig	thog-tu	bcad-pa
),	and	the	‘direct	confidence	in
liberation’	(
gdeng-grol	thog-tu	bca’-ba
).	For	the	original	text,	see	
Bi-ma	sNying-
thig
,	Pt.	1,	Vol.	Ga,	pp.	304-18,	and	Patrul	Rinpoche’s	nineteenth-century
commentary	entitled	
mKhas-pa’i	shri	rgyal-po	mkhas-chos
.	The	background	to
the	revelation	of	Prahevajra’s	testament	is	given	in	Dudjom	Rinpoche,	NSTB,

This	verse	derives	from	the	
Guhyagarbha	Tantra
,	Ch.	13,	v.	2:	There	are	those
of	no	understanding,/	And	those	of	wrong	understanding,/	Those	of	partial
understanding,/	And	those	who	have	not	[quite]	understood	genuine	reality.
As	 explained	 by	 Longchen	 Rabjampa,	 GGFTC,	 pp.	 988-97,	 those	 of	 no
understanding	(
ma-rtogs-pa
)	are	ordinary	persons	who	adhere	to	the	‘vehicles	of
gods	 and	 humans’	 (
devamanuṣyayāna
),	 striving	 after	 excellence	 and	 higher
rebirths	within	cyclic	existence	(
saṃsāra
)	through	the	practice	of	virtue.	Those
of	 misunderstanding	 (
log-rtogs-pa
)	 comprise	 the	 eternalistic	 and	 nihilistic
extremist	philosophers	of	ancient	India,	who	adhere	to	the	Nyayāyika,	Vaiṣṇava,
Sāṃkhyā,	 Vaiśeṣika,	 and	 Bārhaspatya	 standpoints.	 Those	 of	 partial
understanding	(
phyogs-tsam	rtogs-pa
)	comprise	the	pious	attendants	(
śrāvaka
)
who	realise	the	selflessness	of	the	individual	person	(
pudgalanairātmya
)	but	fail
to	realise	the	selflessness	of	phenomena	(
dharmanairātmya
),	and	the	hermit
buddhas	 (
pratyekabuddha
)	 who	 additionally	 realise	 the	 lack	 of	 inherent
existence	(
niḥsvabhāvatā
)	with	respect	to	external	material	phenomena,	but	fail
to	realise	the	lack	of	inherent	existence	in	internal	mental	phenomena.	Lastly,
those	who	do	not	quite	understand	genuine	reality	(
yang-dag	ji-bzhin-nyid-du
ma-rtogs-pa
)	comprise	the	adherents	of	the	causal	vehicles,	who	maintain	the
views	of	Cittamātra	and	Madhyamaka,	realising	respectively	that	phenomena	are

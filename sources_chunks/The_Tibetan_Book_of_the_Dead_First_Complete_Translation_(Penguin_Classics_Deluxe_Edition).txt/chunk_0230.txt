Cutting	through	Resistance
	
khregs-chod

According	to	the	pith	or	esoteric	instructions	(
man-ngag-gi	sde
)	of	the	
Great
Perfection
	
(
Atiyoga
)	there	are	two	meditative	techniques,	which	are	engaged	in
successively.	The	first,	Cutting	through	Resistance	(
khregs-chod
)	focuses	on	the
recognition	of	
primordial	purity
	(
ka-dag
),	the	nature	of	
awareness
	(
rig-pa
),
through	 which	 the	
Buddha-body	 of	 Reality
	 is	 attained.	 The	 second,	
All-
surpassing	Realisation
	
(
thod-rgal
	),	focuses	on	the	recognition	of	
spontaneous
presence
	 (
lhun-grub
),	 eliciting	 and	 recognising	 the	 radiances	 of	
pristine
cognition
	 and	 the	 purity	 of	 our	 psycho-physical	
aggregates
	 and	
elements
,
through	which	the	rainbow-like	
Buddha-body	of	Form
	is	attained.	In	
All-
surpassing	 Realisation
	 practice,	 once	 a	 stable	 realisation	 of	 the	 nature	 of
awareness
	 has	 been	 attained	 through	 Cutting	 through	 Resistance,	 all
phenomenal	appearances	are	liberated	through	a	spontaneous	realisation	of	their
essential	modality	as	
inner	radiance
.	Cutting	through	Resistance	is	the	subject
matter	of	Chapter	4	of	the	present	work.	The	introduction	to	the	
intermediate
state	 of	 reality
,	 in	 Chapter	 11	 of	 our	 text,	 is	 illustrative	 of	 the	 esoteric
instructions	on	
All-surpassing	Realisation
,	which	is	the	pinnacle	of	meditative
practice	according	to	the	
Nyingma
	school.
	
Cyclic	Existence
	
’khor-ba
,	Skt.	
samsāra
A	state	of	existence	conditioned	by	
dissonant	mental	states
	and	the	imprint	of
past	actions
	(
karma
),	characterised	by	suffering	in	a	cycle	of	life,	death	and
rebirth,	in	which	the	
six	classes	of	sentient	beings
	(
ṣaḍgati
;	Tib.	
’gro-ba	rigs-
drug
)	rotate.	Cyclic	existence	emerges	from	
fundamental	ignorance
	(
avidyā
)
through	 a	 process	 known	 as	 the	
twelve	 links	 of	 dependent	 origination
(
dvādaśāṅga-prat
ῑ
tyasamutpāda
	
).	When	
fundamental	ignorance
,	identified	as
the	misapprehension	of	the	nature	of	
actual	reality
	(
dharmatā
),	is	reversed,
cyclic	existence	is	itself	reversed,	and	the	contrasting	state	of	
nirvāṇa
	is	attained,
free	from	suffering	and	the	processes	of	rebirth.	See	
Dependent	Origination
and	Nirvāṇa.
	
Ḍākinī
	
mkha’-’gro-ma
Ḍākin
ῑ
	are	female	
yogin
ῑ
	who	have	attained	either	mundane	or	supramundane
spiritual	
accomplishments
	(
siddhi
),	the	latter	referring	to	the	realisations	of
buddhahood
	
.	They	may	be	human	beings	who	have	achieved	such	attainments,
or	 manifestations	 of	 the	 enlightened	 activity	 of	
meditational	 deities
.	 The
Tibetan	 equivalent	
mkha’-’gro
	 literally	 means	 ‘space	 voyager’,	 space
metaphorically	implying	
emptiness,
	
and	voyager	indicating	someone	immersed

in	its	experience.	The	
ḍākin
ῑ
	are	said	to	confer	enlightened	or	
buddha-activities
on	the	meditator,	in	contrast	to	the	
spiritual	teacher
	who	confers	
blessings
	and
the	
meditatioal	deity
	who	confers	
accomplishments
.

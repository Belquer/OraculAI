d	 which	 does	 not
[necessarily]	 require	 meditation.	 This	 oral	 instruction	 through	 which
buddhahood	can	be	attained	at	the	time	of	death	is	[therefore]	most	valuable	for
those	who	have	not	trained	in	the	cycle	of	Cutting	through	Resistance,	or	[in	the
meditations	of]	the	Illusory	Body,	Dream	Yoga,	and	Inner	Radiance,	and	have
[therefore]	not	realised	the	truth	of	the	four	modes	of	liberation.	In	particular,	[it
is	 valuable]	 for	 ordinary	 persons,	 officials,	 householders	 and	 distracted
individuals	who	have	had	no	time	to	meditate,	despite	having	received	those
[instructions].	That	is,	[it	is	valuable	to	all]	those	who	have	not	engaged	in
experiential	 cultivation,	 even	 though	 they	 may	 have	 obtained	 profound
teachings,	and	who,	[as	a	consequence],	may	die	in	an	ordinary	frame	of	
mind,
having	 left	 the	 instructions	 as	 [unrealised]	 words,	 or	 having	 left	 [their
relationship	to]	the	[sacred]	teachings	as	a	[mere]	theoretical	understanding.
Now,	anyone	who	is	born	is	subsequently	certain	to	die.	Yet	the	time	of	death
is	 unknown.	 Indeed,	 since	 oneâ€™s	 death	 might	 be	 imminent,	 one	 should	 be
constantly	alert	to	[the	signs	which	portend]	death.	In	accordance	with	the
Natural	Liberation	through	[Recognition	of]	the	Visual	Indications	and	Signs	of
Death
,
5
	one	should	analyse	the	signs	indicative	of	remote	death,	the	signs
indicative	of	near	death,	the	signs	indicative	of	uncertain	death,	and	the	signs
indicative	of	inevitable	death.	One	should	also	persevere	with	[the	practices

contained	in]	the	
Ritual	Deception	of	Death
,	as	these	correspond	to	the	signs	of
death	which	might	appear.
6
	If,	on	the	other	hand,	one	were	to	perform	this
consciousness	transference,	either	when	the	signs	of	death	are	not	fully	present
or	even	when	the	signs	are	fully	present	but	without	having	[first]	practised	the
ritual	deception	of	death,	then	one	would,	in	effect,	incur	the	crime	of	slaying	a
deity,	and	the	crime	of	committing	suicide.	This	is	an	even	greater	misdeed	than
committing	[one	of	the	five]	inexpiable	crimes.	Thus,	it	is	essential	that	one
should	perform	the	general	and	specific	ritual	deceptions	of	death,	whichever	is
appropriate,	three	times	or	as	often	as	is	required,	in	accordance	with	the	
Natural
Liberation	of	Fear	through	the	Ritual	Deception	of	Death
.
7
	If,	despite	having
performed	the	[appropriate]	ritual	deception	of	death	on	three	occasions,	the
indications	of	death	are	unaltered,	this	demonstrates	that	death	is	certain	to
occur.	It	is	at	this	time	[only]	therefore	that	one	should	begin	to	engage	in	the
[actual	practice	of]	consciousness	transference.
Since	it	is	said	that	[this	practice	may	confer]	higher	rebirth	or	liberation	even
on	one	who	has	committed	the	five	inexpiable	crimes,	the	timely	application	of
consciousness	transference	can	be	of	extremely	great	benefit.
TRAINING	IN	CONSCIOUSNESS	TRANSFERENCE
[The	practice	of]	consciousness	transference	has	two	aspects:	[namely]	training
and	the	actual	application.
First,	with	regard	to	training:	just	as,	for	example,	when	a	man	faces	the
inevitability	of	the	arrival	of	an	external	foe,	before	his	enemy	approaches,	he
will	prepare	armour,	weapons,	and	arrows,	and	train	in	the	arts	[of	warfare],	but
only	don	[and	apply]	these	when	the	enemy	[actually]	arrives	and	strikes,	so,	in
this	context,	the	training	takes	place	before	the	indications	of	death	have	arisen.
Since	one	does	not	know	when	one	will	die,	training	should	be	undertaken	from
the	present	moment,	for	it	is	essential	that	[one	is	able]	to	complete	the	actual
application	[of	consciousness	transference]	successfully,	when	death	becomes
certain.
Now,	the	training	in	consciousness	transference	may	be	undertaken	[in	two
contexts]:	at	times	when	[general]	guidance	[on	preliminary	practices]	is	being
given,	or	when	specific	guidance	on	consciousness	transference	is	being	given,
whichever	is	appropriate.

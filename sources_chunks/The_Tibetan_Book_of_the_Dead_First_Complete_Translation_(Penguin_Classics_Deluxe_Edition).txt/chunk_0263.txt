the	
continuum	of	the	path
	which	are	expounded	in

the	
tantras
	are	regarded	as	the	means	by	which	
nirvāṇa
	might	be	attained.
Classical	Buddhist	literature	mentions	three	types	of	
nirvāṇa
:	1)	
nirvāṇa
	with
residue,	
i.e.
	the	initial	state	of	
nirvāṇa
	when	the	person	is	still	dependent	on	his
or	her	karmically	conditioned	psycho-physical	
aggregates
	
(
skandha
);	2)	
nirvāṇa
without	residue,	
i.e.
	an	advanced	state	of	
nirvāṇa
	where	the	former	aggregates
have	also	been	consumed	within	emptiness;	and	3)	non-abiding	
nirvāṇa
,	
i.e.
	a
state	that	has	transcended	both	the	extremes	of	conditioned	cyclic	
existence
	and
also	the	isolated	peace	or	quiescence	of	
nirvāṇa
.

Both	
Sugata
	(One	Who	Has	Gone	to	Bliss)	and	
Tathāgata
	(One	Who	Has	Thus
Gone)	are	epithets	of	
Buddha
.	However,	the	expression	‘nucleus	of	the	
sugata
’
or	‘nucleus	of	the	
tathāgata
’	refers	to	the	seed	of	
buddha	nature
	present	but
uncultivated	in	the	mental	continuum	of	all	sentient	beings,	and	without	which
the	attainment	of	
enlightenment
	or	
buddhahood
	would	be	impossible.	See

Nyingma
	
rnying-ma
The	oldest	school	of	Tibetan	Buddhism,	based	on	the	teaching	traditions	and
texts	introduced	to	Tibet	during	the	earliest	phase	of	Buddhist	propagation,
which	coincided	with	the	reigns	of	the	Buddhist	kings	of	the	
Yarlung
	dynasty	in
the	eighth	to	ninth	centuries.	These	traditions	were	introduced	from	India	by
Padmasambhava
	
,	
Vimalamitra
	and	others,	and	maintained	in	Tibet	by	the
twenty-five	disciples	of	
Padmasambhava
.	The	distinction	between	the	old	and

new	schools	of	Tibetan	Buddhism	is	made	on	the	basis	of	the	interregnum	which
followed	the	persecution	of	Buddhism	during	the	ninth	century	and	preceded	the
second	or	later	phase	of	Buddhist	propagation	when	a	further	corpus	of	Buddhist
literature	was	introduced	from	India	by	
Marpa
,	
Drokmi	Lotsāwa
,	
Atiśa
,	
Rinchen
Zangpo
	and	others	during	the	eleventh	century.	Lineages	derived	from	the	earlier
phase	and	works	translated	before	the	interregnum	are	known	as	
Nyingma
,	or	the
‘Ancient	Translation	school’,	in	contrast	to	those	which	emerged	thereafter	and
are	known	as	
Sarma
,	or	the	‘New	Translation	schools’.
	
Nyingthig
	
snying-thig
The	teachings	known	as	the	‘Innermost	Spirituality’	or	‘Heart-Essence’	(
snying-
thig
)	are	the	most	important	and	essential	pith	instructions	within	the	esoteric
instructional	 class	 (
upadeśavarga
)	 of	
Atiyoga
,	 including	 the	 techniques	 of
Cutting	 through	 Resistance
	 and	
All-surpassing	 Realisation
.	 Two	 distinct
lineages	of	these	teachings	were	introduced	from	India	by	
Padmasambhava
	and
Vimalamitra
,	and	then	transmitted	with	great	secrecy	in	Tibet	until	the	time	of
Longchen	Rabjampa
	(fourteenth	century),	who	integrated	them	in	his	
Four-
part	Innermost	Spirituality
	(
sNying-thig	ya-bzhi
),	from	which	time	they	were
widely	disseminated	and	practised.	Diverse	traditions	of	
Nyingthig
	are	practised
within	 the	
treasure
	 (
gter-ma
)	 traditions	 of	 the	
Nyingma
	 school,	 the	 most
influential	in	more	recent	times	being	the	
Innermost	Spirituality	of	Longchenpa
(
Klong-chen	snying-thig
),	which	was	revealed	during	the	eighteenth	century	by
Rigdzin	Jigme	Lingpa
	on	the	basis	of	his	inspirational	
visions	of	
Longchen
Rabjampa
,	and	which	has	since	become	the	most	popular	recension	of	
Nyingthig
teachings	throughout	Tibet.

,	O	teachers,	infinite	buddhas	without	exception,
To	remain	[present]	and	not	to	pass	into	nirvāṇa,
And	to	continue	to	enact	deeds	of	extensive	benefit	for	the	sake	of	beings,
Until	the	world-systems	of	cyclic	existence	have	been	emptied!
	
The	Branch	of	the	Dedication	[of	Merit]	to	the	Unsurpassed	Greater	Vehicle
[By	the	power	of]	whatever	past,	present	and	future	virtues	I	accumulate,
May	all	sentient	beings,	throughout	the	furthest	reaches	of	space,
Mature	into	worthy	recipients	of	the	unsurpassed	Greater	Vehicle,
And	then	swiftly	attain	the	status	of	the	infinite	Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities!

From	the	field	of	reality’s	expanse,	uncreated	and	pure,
Within	a	celestial	palace,	which	is	a	seminal	point	[of	light],	pure,	unceasing,
and	radiant,
Through	the	natural	expressive	power	of	one’s	own	mind,	uncontrived	and
empty,

Intrinsic	awareness,	radiant	and	empty,	arises	in	the	form	of	Vajrasattva,
[Seated]	 upon	 a	 bejewelled	 throne	 adorned	 with	 lotus,	 sun	 and	 moon
[cushions].
[Vajrasattva	 is]	 white,	 radiant,	 with	 one	 face,	 two	 arms,	 and	 a	 smiling
countenance;
The	right	hand	holds	a	vajra	at	the	heart,
[Symbolising	the	union]	of	awareness	and	emptiness,
The	left	hand	supports	a	bell	[resting]	on	the	hip,
[Symbolising	the	union]	of	appearances	and	emptiness;
And	the	head	[is	adorned	with	a	garland	of]	perfect	buddhas,
[Representing]	the	five	enlightened	families	of	Those	Gone	to	Bliss.
Thus,	[Vajrasattva]	manifests	in	the	form	of	the	Buddha-body	of	Perfect
Resource,
[Exquisitely]	adorned	with	silks	and	jewels,
Seated	in	the	posture	of	royal	ease,
With	the	right	leg	extended,	and	the	left	drawn	in.

Having	performed	the	twofold	act	of	benefiting	[self	and	others]	through	the
emanation	and	reabsorption	[of	light	from	these	syllables],	the	obscurations	of
conceptual	thought	are	purified.	Do	not	be	distracted!	Recite	this	quintessential
[mantra]	of	the	hundred	sacred	enlightened	families	as	much	as	possible,	so	that
the	two	obscurations	may	be	cleansed.
MAIN	PRACTICE

Having	thus	purified	the	[two]	obscurations,	one	should	visualise	the	assembled
Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities	of	the	hundred	sacred	enlightened	families	as	a
maṇḍala	[of	deities]	within	one’s	body,	and	pray.	It	is	in	this	context	that	the
aspirational	 prayers	 of	 the	 intermediate	 states	 are	 recited.	 [The	 combined
practice]	is	as	follows:
Then,	[maintaining	the	recognition	of]	oneself	as	Vajrasattva,
In	the	celestial	palace	of	one’s	own	precious	heart,
One	clearly	discerns	a	seminal	point	[formed	of]	the	five	lights,
Whose	nature	is	the	five	pure	essences	[of	the	five	elements],
[And	from	this],	the	thirty-six	peaceful	buddhas
7
	radiantly	manifest,
Amidst	a	radiant	and	vibrant	maṇḍala	suffused	by	the	five	pristine	cognitions,
Their	bodies	composed	of	five	lights,	the	unimpeded	[union	of]	emptiness	and
radiance,
[Seated]	upon	a	tier	of	lotus,	sun	and	moon	[cushions],
Supported	by	lion,	elephant,	horse,	peacock	and	c
ῑ
vaṃc
ῑ
vaka	[thrones].
	
OṂ	ĀḤ	HŪṂ
Within	the	expanse	of	a	seminal	point	located	at	the	centre	of	one’s	heart,
The	primordial	lord,	the	unchanging	buddha-body	of	light,
Samantabhadra,	the	Buddha-body	of	Reality,	blue	in	colour,
And	Samantabhadr
ῑ
,	the	expanse	of	reality,	white	in	colour,
Are	indivisibly	united,	both	in	the	posture	of	meditative	equipoise,
Seated	upon	lotus,	sun	and	moon	cushions,
[Symbolising	the	union	of]	radiance	and	emptiness.
To	you,	the	supreme	ancestors	of	the	buddhas	of	past,	present	and	future,

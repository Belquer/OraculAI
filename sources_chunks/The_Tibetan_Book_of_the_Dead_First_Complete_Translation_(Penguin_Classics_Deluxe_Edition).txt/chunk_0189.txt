The	strict	vows	made	in	the	past	(
sngon-gyi	dam-bca’	gnyan-po
)	are	those
taken	by	buddhas	and	bodhisattvas	in	former	lives	pertaining	to	the	propagation
of	the	Buddhist	teaching	and	the	bodhisattva	vow	to	remove	the	sufferings	of	all
beings.	See

Listed	among	the	eighty	minor	marks	(

Buddhist
Cosmology
,	pp.	73-5.	Each	great	aeon	(
mahākalpa
)	of	cyclical	time	is	said	to
comprise	the	four	eras	of	creation	(
vivartakalpa
),	duration	(
vivartasthāyikalpa
),
dissolution	(
saṃvartakalpa
),	and	non-duration	(
saṃvartasthāyikalpa
).	The
expression	‘final	era’	(
dus-mtha’
)	refers	to	the	period	of	dissolution.

The	specific	blessing	which	arises	from	the	Buddha-body	of	Reality	(
chos-
sku’i	byin-rlab
)	is	‘primordially	pure’	(
ka-dag
),	indicating	that	in	this	context	the
Buddha-body	of	Reality	is	directly	realised	through	the	Atiyoga	practice	called
‘Cutting	through	Resistance	to	primordial	purity’	(
ka-dag	khregs-chod
),	on
which	see	Ch.	4;	also	Dudjom	Rinpoche,	NSTB,	pp.	335-7.

This	blessing	is	‘spontaneously	present’	(

The	pristine	cognition	of	the	Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource,	here	referred
to	as	‘naturally	liberated	in	supreme	bliss’	(
bde-chen	rang-grol
),	comprises	the
mirror-like	pristine	cognition	(
ādarśajñāna
),	the	pristine	cognition	of	sameness
(
samatājñāna
),	and	the	pristine	cognition	of	discernment	(
pratyavekṣanajñāna
	
).
See	glossary	under	pristine	cognition.

The	pristine	cognition	referred	to	here	is	the	pristine	cognition	of	the	Buddha-
body	of	Emanation,	otherwise	known	as	the	pristine	cognition	of
accomplishment	(
kṛtyupasthānajñāna
).	See	glossary	under	pristine	cognition.

The	natural	pristine	cognition	(
rang-byung	ye-shes

in	union	refers	to	the	unity	of	all	the	five	aspects	of	pristine	cognition
(
pañcajñāna
	
).

These	relationships	are	vividly	expressed	in	Chapter	11	of	our	text,	‘The	Great
Liberation	by	Hearing’,	where	specific	instructions	are	given	for	recognising	the
spiritual	opportunities	that	occur	at	the	moment	of	death,	that	occur	during	the
intermediate	 state	 of	 reality,	 and	 that	 occur	 as	 the	 processes	 of	 rebirth	 are
experienced.	Here	the	instructions	speak	of	a	recognition	which	assimilates	the
moment	of	death	with	the	Buddha-body	of	Reality,	the	intermediate	state	of
reality	with	the	Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource	and	the	intermediate	state	of
rebirth	with	the	Buddha-body	of	Emanation.

‘Cutting	through	Resistance’	and	the	direct	introduction	to	awareness	are	the
subject	 matter	 of	 Chapter	 4	 of	 the	 present	 work.	 The	 introduction	 to	 the
intermediate	state	of	reality,	in	Chapter	11	of	our	text,	is	illustrative	of	the
esoteric	instructions	on	‘All-surpassing	Realisation’,	which	is	the	pinnacle	of
meditative	practice	according	to	the	Nyingma	school.

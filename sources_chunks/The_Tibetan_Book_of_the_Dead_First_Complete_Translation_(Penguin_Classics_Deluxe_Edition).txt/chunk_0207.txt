Note	that	the	text	associates	both	the	dull	white	light	of	the	god-realms	and
the	dull	green	light	of	the	animal	realms	(see	p.	253)	with	the	propensities	for
delusion	(
gti-mug
).	More	generally,	delusion	is	recognised	as	the	primary
dissonant	mental	state	giving	rise	to	birth	among	the	animals,	and	pride	as	the
primary	dissonant	mental	state	giving	rise	to	birth	among	the	gods.
45
	
Note	that	pride	is	more	generally	associated	with	birth	in	the	god	realms,
while	it	is	attachment	(
’dod-chags
)	or	a	combination	of	all	five	dissonant	mental
states	that	is	said	to	generate	birth	as	a	human	being.	See	above,	Ch.	5.

This	passage	associates	the	white	luminosity	with	the	pristine	cognition	of
reality’s	expanse	and	Vairocana,	and	the	blue	light	with	the	mirror-like	pristine
cognition	and	Akṣobhya,	reversing	the	earlier	sequence.	On	this	distinction,	see

	Along	with	bliss	and	radiance,	this	‘non-conceptual

with	the	practice	of	the	perfection	stage	(

This	‘vision	of	the	four	pristine	cognitions	combined’	(

)	is	said	to	occur	in	relation	to	the	‘hollow	passageway	of	Vajrasattva’
(
rdo-rje	sems-dpa’	khong-gseng-gi	lam
),	a	synonym	for	the	central	channel	of
the	body,	through	which	transference	of	consciousness	(
’pho-ba
)	is	also	effected.

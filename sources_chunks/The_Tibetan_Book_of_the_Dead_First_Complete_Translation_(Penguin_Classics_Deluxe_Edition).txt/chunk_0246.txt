understanding	 of	 the	 causal	 dynamics	 of	 karmic	 actions	 as	 well	 as	 its
understanding	 of	 the	 process	 of	 conditioning.	 For	 example,	 when	 a	 person

commits	an	act,	such	as	the	negative	act	of	killing,	the	act	itself	does	not	last.	So
that	which	connects	the	committing	of	this	act	and	the	experiencing	of	its
consequence	in	the	future,	in	some	instances	in	a	future	life,	is	the	habitual
tendencies	imprinted	upon	one’s	psyche	by	the	act	committed.	Similarly,	when	a
strong	emotion	such	as	a	powerful	feeling	of	hatred	arises,	although	the	actual
emotion	may	subside	after	a	while,	the	experience	leaves	a	mark	or	an	imprint,
which	will	continue	to	have	an	impact	on	the	person’s	attitudes	and	emotions	as
well	as	behaviour.	It	is	the	collection	of	such	countless	habitual	tendencies
imprinted	 in	 our	 psyche	 by	
dissonant	 mental	 states
	 that	 constitutes	 the
obscuration	of	misconceptions	concerning	the	known	range	of	phenomena	
(Skt.
jñeyāvaraṇa
),	the	total	eradication	of	which	occurs	only	when	one	achieves	full
awakening	or	
buddhahood

rta-mgrin
The	name	of	a	wrathful	deity,	usually	red	in	colour,	with	a	green	horse’s	head
and	 neck	 (
rta-mgrin
)	 protruding	 from	 amongst	 the	 hair	 on	 his	 head.	 The
teachings	and	the	texts	associated	with

	belong	within	the	
sādhana
class	of	
Mahāyoga
,	where	they	are	known	as	the	
tantras
	of	buddha-speech.	In
this	 respect,	
Hayagr
ῑ
va
	
is	 considered	 to	 be	 the	 wrathful	 counterpart	 of
Avalokiteśvara
.	More	generally,	as	in	our	text,	he	is	depicted	as	a	gatekeeper	of
certain	
maṇḍalas
	and	sacred	shrines.	See	Appendix	Two.

rang-rgyal

pratyekabuddha
The	 practitioners	 of	 the	
Lesser	 Vehicle
	 (
h
ῑ
nayāna
)	 include	 both	
pious
attendants
	
(
śrāvaka
)	and	hermit	buddhas.	Among	these,	the	hermit	buddhas	are
those	who	pursue	the	path	to	
liberation
	without	relying	on	a	teacher,	following	a
natural	 predisposition.	 According	 to	
Maitreya
’s	
Ornament	 of	 Emergent
Realisation
,	the	accomplishment	of	the	hermit	buddhas	is	considered	to	surpass
that	of	the	
pious	attendants
	in	the	sense	that	they	realise	the	
emptiness
	of
external	phenomena,	composed	of	atomic	particles,	in	addition	to	realising	the
emptiness
	of	the	individual	personality	(
pudgala
).	However,	unlike	
bodhisattvas
they	are	said	not	to	realise	that	the	internal	phenomena	of	
conciousness
	too	are
without	
inherent	existence
.	The	
realisation
	of	a	hermit	buddha	relies	not	only
on	the	
renunciation
	or	monastic	discipline,	which	is	also	undertaken	by	
pious
attendants
,	 but	 on	 their	 comprehension	 of	 the	
twelve	 links	 of	 dependent
origination
	and	ability	to	reverse	these	through	the	power	of	
meditation

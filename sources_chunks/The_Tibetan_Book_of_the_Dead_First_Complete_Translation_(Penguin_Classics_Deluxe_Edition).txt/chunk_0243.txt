generation	Stage
	
bskyed-rim
,	Skt.	
utpattikrama
According	to	the	traditions	of	the	
tantras
,	the	main	practices	of	
meditation
which	 follow	 the	 successful	 conclusion	 of	 the	
preliminary	 practices
(
sngon-’gro
)	 include	 the	 generation	 stage	 and	 the	
perfection	 stage
	 (Skt.
sampannakrama
).	Both	the	generation	and	
perfection	stages
	of	meditation	are
related	to	transforming	our	mundane	experiences	of	each	of	the	phases	of	life
and	death,	namely:	the	
intermediate	states	of	the	time	of	death,	of	reality,	of
rebirth
,	and	
of	living
.	The	generation	stage	is	characterised	by	the	meditative
processes	of	the	practitioner’s	gradual	identification	with	the	form	and	
pristine
cognition
	of	the	
meditational	deity
	and	it	is	during	this	stage	that,	with	the
support	of	
mantra
	recitation,	the	elaborate	visualisation	of	the	deity	is	gradually
generated	 and	 stabilised.	 This	 process,	 known	 as	 self-generation,	 is	 a
simulacrum	of	bringing	the	three	
buddha-bodies
	on	to	the	path	and	is	composed
therefore	of	three	principal	aspects:	dissolution	into	
emptiness
	
(
Buddha-body
of	 Reality
),	 arising	 into	 a	 subtle	 form	 such	 as	 a	
seed-syllabe
	 or	
symbol
(
Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource
),	and	full	emergence	into	the	deity’s	form
(
Buddha-body	of	Emanation
).	See	the	Introductory	Commentary	by	HH	the
Dalai	Lama	and	
Perfection	Stage

Generative	Essences
	
byang-sems/thig-le
,	Skt.	
bodhicitta/bindu
In	the	
tantras
	and	in	Tibetan	medicine,	the	generative	essences	or	fluids	are
considered	as	arising	from	a	supreme	
seminal	point
	(
thig-le	chen-po
)	located	in
the	middle	of	the	heart	centre.	From	the	perspective	of	the	
tantras
	this	supreme
seminal	point
	is	regarded	as	the	seed	of	
buddhahood
	and	from	the	perspective
of	Tibetan	medicine	it	is	regarded	as	the	basis	of	both	physical	and	mental
health.	This	supreme	
seminal	point
	at	the	heart	is	considered	to	be	the	size	of	a
small	pea	or	large	mustard	seed	and	it	incorporates	the	pure	essences	(
dvangs-
ma
)	of	the	five	elements,	the	presence	of	which	is	indicated	by	its	five-coloured
glow.	From	the	perspective	of	the	
tantras
	the	very	subtle	
vital	energy
,	known	as
the	life-bearing	wind	or	breath,	dwells	inside	this	
seminal	point
	and	at	the
culmination	of	the	
intermediate	state	of	the	time	of	death
	all	vital	energies
ultimately	dissolve	into	it	and	the	
inner	radiance
	of	the	ground	dawns.	During
life,	a	single	
seminal	point
	abides	in	each	of	the	five	
energy	centres
	and	each
seminal	point	is	whiter	at	the	top	and	redder	at	the	bottom.	At	the	crown	centre
the	whiter	element	predominates	and	at	the	level	of	the	genitalia	the	redder
element	predominates.	According	to	Tibetan	medicine,	white	generative	fluids
are	said	to	produce	bone	tissue	in	the	embryo,	and	it	is	from	the	bone	marrow
that	both	semen	and	breast	milk	are	said	to	be	produced.	Red	generative	fluids
are	said	to	produce	blood,	flesh	and	skin.	At	their	least	subtle	level,	therefore,	the
former	are	identified	with	semen	and	the	latter	with	menstrual	blood.	See	also

Gods
	
lha
,	Skt.	
deva
One	of	the	
six	classes	of	living	beings
	(
’gro-ba	rigs-drug
).	The	mode	of	being
and	activity	of	the	gods	is	said	to	be	engendered	and	dominated	by	exaltation,
indulgence	and	pride.	The	gods	exist	in	realms	higher	than	that	of	the	human
realm	in	the	world-system	of	desire	(
kāmadhātu
),	and	also	in	the	world-systems
of	 form	 (
rūpadhātu
	
)	 and	 formlessness	 (
ārūpyadhātu
).	 See

Seven-limbed	Practise
	
yan-lag	bdun-pa
A	
preliminary	practice
	 which	 is	 normally	 undertaken	 as	 a	 prelude	 to	 the
generation	 stage
	 of	 meditation.	 The	 seven	 limbs	 together	 constitute	 a
comprehensive	 practice	 for	 purifying	 negative	 potentials	 and	 accumulating
merit
,	thus	laying	a	stable	basis	for	a	successful	meditational	session.	The	seven

limbs	in	their	proper	sequence	are:	1)	paying	homage	through	
prostration
,	2)
making	
offerings
,	 3)	 purifying	
non-virtuous
	
habits,	 4)	 rejoicing	 in	 the
wholesome	actions	of	others	and	oneself,	5)	requesting	the	
buddhas
	to	teach,	6)
appealing	to	the	
budddhas
	not	to	enter	into	
nirvāṇa
,	and	7)	the	
dedication	of
merit
.	Our	Chapter	5	includes	an	additional	three.

the	 legs	 are	 crossed	 in	 the	 ‘

’	 (
vajrāsana
),	 the	 back
straight,	the	hands	in	the	gesture	of	
meditative	equipoise
,	the	eyes	focused	on
the	tip	of	the	nose,	the	chin	slightly	tucked	in,	the	lips	and	teeth	set	in	their
natural	positions,	and	the	tip	of	the	tongue	touching	the	palate.

Signalessness
	
mtshan-ma	med-pa
,	Skt.	
nirlakṣaṇa
Signlessness,	along	with	
emptiness
	(Skt.	
śūnyatā
)	and	aspirationlessness	(Skt.
nirpraṇidhāna
),	is	regarded	as	one	of	the	three	approaches	to	liberation	(
rnam-
thar	sgo	gsum
)	which	are	the	hallmarks	of	the	teachings	on	the	
perfection	of
discrinative	awareness
	(Skt
.	prajñāpāramitā
).	Signlessness	is	the	antithesis	of
substantialist	views
	
(
mtshan-’dzin
)	-	the	perspective	that	grasps	at	the	inherent
existence	of	things	by	means	of	their	characteristics	such	as	colours,	forms	and
other	properties.
	
Single	Nature	of	Mind

In	Chapter	4	of	our	text	the	phrase	‘the	single	nature	of	mind’	is	a	synonym	for
the	ultimate	nature	of	mind	(

),	or	the	
actual	reality
	of	mind.
	
Six	Classes	of	Sentient/Living	Beings
	
’gro-ba	rigs-drug
,	Skt.	
ṣaḍgati
A	birth	in	
cyclic	existence
	is	characterised	as	occuring	among	one	or	other	of	the
six	 classes	 of	 living	 beings,	 depending	 on	 the	 nature	 and	 maturity	 of	 an
individual’s	
past	actions
.	The	six	classes	are:	1)	
gods
	(
deva
),	mundane	celestial
beings	whose	primary	mental	state	is	one	of	pride	or	exaltation,	2)	
antigods
(
asura
),	who	are	predominantly	hostile	and	jealous,	3)	human	beings,	who	are
influenced	by	all	five	
dissonant	mental	states
,	4)	animals,	who	are	under	the

sway	of	instinct	and	obfuscation,	5)	
anguished	spirits
	(
preta
),	who	are	under	the
sway	of	
attachment
	
and	unsatisfied	craving,	and	6)	the	denizens	of	the	
hells
(
naraka
),	 who	 are	 overwhelmed	 by	 hatred,	 anger	 and	 fear.	 Since	 all	 five
dissonant	mental	states	have	influence	on	human	beings,	it	is	not	inappropriate
to	 look	 upon	 all	 of	 these	 conditions	 also	 as	 extrapolations	 of	 human
psychological	states.	In	our	text	the	primary	causes	of	rebirth	in	each	of	these	six
realms	are	respectively	identified	as:	pride,	jealousy,	
attachment
,	
delusion
,
miserliness	and	hatred.	See	also

In	certain	instances	in	our	text	when	the	context	relates	to	rebirth	among	the	six
classes	of	beings,	this	enumeration	does	not	refer	to	the	well-known	
abhidharma
category	of	the	six	primary	
dissonant	Dental	states
:	
fundamental	ignorance
,
attachment
	
,	
aversion
,	pride,	doubt,	and	dissonant	or	afflictive	views,	but	to	the
six	poisons	(

)	that	are	said	to	generate	rebirth	among	the	six	classes	of
living	beings,	namely:	pride,	jeal

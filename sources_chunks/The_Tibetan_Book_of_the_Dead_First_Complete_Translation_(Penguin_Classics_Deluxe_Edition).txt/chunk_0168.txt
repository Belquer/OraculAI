Liberation	by	Wearing:	Natural	Liberation	of	the	Psycho-physical
Aggregates
CONTEXT
As	explained	in	the	earlier	chapters,	this	cycle	of	teachings	contains	a
number	of	instructions	which	can	effect	liberation	from	cyclic	existence,
without	prior	experience	of	the	meditations	associated	with	the	Vehicle	of
Indestructible	Reality	(
Vajrayāna
).	 Amongst	 these	 expressions	 of	 the
sacred	teachings	is	this	
Liberation	by	Wearing
,	which	is	said	to	effect
liberation	simply	by	its	being	worn	as	a	mantra	amulet	on	the	body	at	the
time	of	death	or	by	its	being	heard	at	the	time	of	death.
The	text	of	this	chapter	expresses	the	enlightened	intention	of	the
Peaceful	 and	 Wrathful	 Deities	 in	 the	 form	 of	 mantra-letters.	 These
mantra-letters	are	the	resonance	of	the	pure	awareness	of	the	deities
expressed	in	the	form	of	letter	shapes	and	sounds.
Many	practitioners	of	this	cycle	of	teachings	wear	this	mantra	circle	in
an	amulet	throughout	their	lives.	For	others	it	is	recommended	that	the
mantra	amulet	should	be	worn	at	the	time	of	death	and	not	removed.	It	is
also	recommended	that	this	text	should	be	read	aloud	at	the	conclusion	of
each	reading	of	the	
Liberation	by	Hearing
	
(Chapter	11).

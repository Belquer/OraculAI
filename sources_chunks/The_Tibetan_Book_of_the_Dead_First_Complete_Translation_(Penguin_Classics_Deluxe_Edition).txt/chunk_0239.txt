Formal	Description
	
mngon-rtogs
,	Skt.	
abhisamaya
While	practising	the	
generation	stage
	(
utpattikrama
)	of	meditation,	the	
deities
are	visualised	in	accordance	with	their	formal	descriptions	which	are	set	down	in

the	
texts	of	the	appropriate	
means	for	attainment
	(
sgrub-thabs
,	Skt.	
sādhana
).
In	other	contexts	the	term	‘
abhisamaya
’	conveys	the	sense	of	‘emergent	or	clear
realisation’,	 as	 in	
Maitreya
’s	
Ornament	 of	 Emergent	 Realisation

buddha
’s
activity,	namely:	pacification	(
śāntikriyā
,	Tib.	
zhi-ba’i	las
),	which	includes	the
pacification	of	obstacles	to	spiritual	practice,	illness	and	the	causes	of	harm	to
society	and	the	environment;	enrichment	(
puṣṭikriyā
,	Tib.	
rgyas-pa’i	las
),	which
includes	increasing	the	lifespan	and	prosperity;	subjugation	(
vaṣitakriyā
,	Tib.
dbang-gi	las
),	which	includes	the	controlling	of	negative	and	hostile	forces;	and
wrath	or	transformation	(
maraṇakriyā
,	Tib.	
drag-po’i	las
),	which	includes	the
elimination	of	
malevolent	forces
.	The	ritual	enactment	of	these	four	rites	is
often	undertaken	in	the	context	of	a	
burnt	offering
	ritual	(

).

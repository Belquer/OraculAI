ost
advanced	level	of	subtle	body,	known	in	the	
tantras
	as	the	pure	
illusory	body
(
sgyu-lus
),	 is	 experienced	 only	 when	 an	 indivisible	 unity	 of	
buddha-body
,
speech
	and	
mind
	has	been	actualised	at	the	conclusion	of	the	
generation
	and
perfection	stages
	of	meditation.	A	similitude	of	such	a	subtle	body	can	be
experienced	during	the	practice	of	
dream	yoga
,	when	the	level	of	consciousness
is	relatively	subtle	and	deep,	due	to	the	temporary	cessation	of	active	sensory
processes.	The	
mental	body
	(
yid-lus
)	experienced	during	the	
intermediate	state
of	rebirth
	is	also	a	form	of	subtle	body.
	
Suffering
	
sdug-bsngal
,	Skt.	
duḥkhatā
In	a	Buddhist	context,	the	term	‘suffering’	is	used	in	a	broad	sense	and	includes
not	only	physical	sensations	but	also	mental	experiences,	that	is	to	say	all	the
essentially	unsatisfactory	experiences	of	life	in	
cyclic	existence
.	The	various
forms	of	suffering	can	be	categorised	into	three	groups:	1)	the	suffering	of
suffering	(
duḥkhaduḥkhatā
),	2)	the	suffering	of	change	(
vipariṇāmaduḥkhatā
),
and	3)	the	suffering	of	pervasive	conditioning	(
saṃskāraduḥkhatā
).	The	first
category	refers	to	all	our	physical	sensations	and	mental	experiences	which	are
self-evident	to	us	as	suffering	and	towards	which	we	have	spontaneous	feelings
of	 aversion.	 The	 second	 category	 includes	 all	 our	 experiences	 which	 are
normally	 recognised	 as	 pleasant	 and	 desirable,	 but	 which	 are	 nonetheless
suffering	in	that	persistent	indulgence	in	these	always	results	in	the	changed
attitude	of	dissatisfaction	and	boredom.	It	is	only	through	reflection	that	the
unsatisfactory	nature	of	such	experiences	can	be	realised.	The	third	category
refers	to	a	basic	level	of	suffering	which	underlies	the	round	of	birth,	sickness,
old	age	and	death.	This	suffering	serves	as	the	cause	of	our	experiences	of	the
two	other	classes	of	suffering.	It	is	called	pervasive	because	it	extends	to	all
forms	of	life	in	cyclic	existence,	irrespective	of	whether	or	not	life-forms	are
endowed	with	bodily	existence.	Suffering	is	identified	as	the	first	of	the	
four
noble	truths
	(Skt
.	caturāryasatya
	
),	which	were	taught	by	
Śākyamuni	Buddha
in	the	course	of	his	first	discourse,	and	the	entire	path	of	Buddhism,	embracing
all	its	
Vehicles
	(
yāna
),	may	be	seen	as	the	ways	of	eliminating	suffering,	thus

bringing	an	end	to	
cyclic	existence
	itself.

Supernormal	Cognitive	Power
	
mngon-shes
,	Skt.	
abhijñā
Supernormal	cognitive	power	is	considered	to	be	a	by-product	of	advanced
meditation
	
,	 but	 similitudes	 of	 these	 powers	 are	 said	 to	 arise	 during	 the
intermediate	state	of	rebirth
	(
srid-pa’i	bar-do
).	Six	powers	are	specifically
enumerated:	clairvoyance	(
lha’i	mig-gi	mngon-shes
,	Skt.	
divyacakṣurabhijñā
);
clairaudience	(
lha’i	rna-ba’i	mngon-shes
,	Skt.	
divyaśrotrābhijñā
);	knowledge	of
the	minds	of	others	(
gzhan-sems	shes-pa’i	mngon-shes
,	Skt.	
paracittābhijñā
);
miraculous	abilities	(
rdzu-’phrul-gyi	shes-pa’i	mngon-shes
,	Skt.	
ṛddhyabhijñā
);
knowledge	 of	 past	 lives	 (
sngon-gnas	 rjes-su	 dran-pa’i	 mngon-shes
,	 Skt.

);	and	knowledge	that	the	flow	of	all	corrupt	past
actions	 has	 ceased	 (
zag-pa	 zad-pa’i	 mngon-shes
,	 Skt.	
āsravakṣayābhijñā
).
Among	these,	the	first	five	are	said	to	be	mundane	powers,	whereas	the	sixth	is
possessed	by	
buddhas
	alone.

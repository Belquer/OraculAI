cyclic	existence
	instead	of	simply	seeking	freedom
from	
suffering
	for	oneself.	Philosophically,	the	
bodhisattva
	is	said	to	have	fully
realised	the	two	aspects	of	
selflessness,
	with	respect	to	
dissonant	mentalstates
and	the	nature	of	all	phenomena.

Bon
An	ancient	spiritual	tradition,	considered	by	some	scholars	to	be	of	Zoroastrian
or	Kashmiri	Buddhist	origin,	which	was	widespread	in	Tibet,	particularly	in	the
far-western	 region	 of	
Zhangzhung
	 prior	 to	 the	 official	 introduction	 and
establishment	of	Buddhism.	Although	its	literature	clearly	distinguishes	it	from
both	the	indigenous	shamanism	or	animism	of	Tibet	and	the	Buddhist	traditions,
it	has	over	the	last	several	hundred	years	assimilated	many	of	the	Buddhist
teachings	 and	 developed	 a	 neo-Buddhist	 theoretical	 foundation.	 The	
Bon
tradition	is	particularly	strong	in	the	
Shang
	valley	of	Western	Tibet,	in	
Kongpo
,
Khyungpo
	and	the	
Ngawa
	
region	of	
Amdo

Bone	relics
	
gdung/ring-srel
Within	the	tradition	of	the	
Great	Perfection
	(
rdzogs-pa	chen-po
),	four	kinds	of
relics	are	said	to	be	left	behind	following	the	death	of	an	
accomplished	master
.
These	are:	relics	of	the	
Buddha-body	of	Reality
	(
chos-sku’i	ring-srel
	),	relics	in
the	form	of	major	and	minor	bone	remains	(
sku-gdung	ring-srel
),	relics	in	the
form	of	clothing	(
sku-bal	ring-srel
	),	and	relics	of	miniature	size	(
nyung-ngu	lta-
bu’i	ring-srel
	).	Among	these,	the	major	bone	relics	(
gdung
)	and	minor	bone
relics	
(ring-srel
)	are	retrieved	from	the	funeral	pyre.	Biographical	literature
suggests	that	the	veneration	of	such	relics	has	been	continuously	observed	within
Buddhism	from	the	time	of	
Sākyamuni
	
Buddha
,	whose	own	bone	relics	were
interred	within	eight	
stūpas
.	Five	kinds	of	major	bone	relic	are	specifically
enumerated.	See	Chapter	14.

Buddha
	
sangs-rgyas
The	 Sanskrit	 term	 buddha	 literally	 means	 ‘awakened’,	 ‘developed’,	 and
‘enlightened’.	The	Tibetan	equivalent	
sangs-rgyas
	is	a	combination	of	
sangs-pa
(‘awakened’	or	‘purified’),	and	
rgyas-pa
	(‘developed’).	These	two	words	in	this
context	denote	a	full	awakening	from	
fundamental	ignorance
	(
avidyā
)	in	the
form	of	the	
two	obscurations
	
(
dvayāvaraṇa
)	and	a	full	
realisation
	of	true
knowledge,	
i.e.
	 the	
pristine	 cognition
	
(	
jñāna
)	 of	
buddha-mind
.	 A	 fully
awakened	being	is	therefore	one	who,	as	a	result	of	training	the	mind	through	the
bodhisattva
	
paths
,	 has	 finally	 realised	 his/	
her	 full	 potential	 for	 complete
enlightenment
	 (
bodhi
),	 and	 has	 eliminated	 all	 the	 obscurations	 to	 true
knowledge	and	
liberation
.	Buddhas	are	characterised	according	to	their	five
fruitional	aspects	of	
buddha-body
	(
kāya
),	
buddha-speech
	(
vāk
),	
buddha-mind
(
citta
),	
buddha-attrattributes
	 (
guṇa
),	 and	
buddha-activities
	 (
krṭyakriyā
),
which	are	poetically	described	in	some	Tibetan	literature	as	the	‘five	wheels	of
inexhaustible	adornment’	(
mi-zad-pa’i	rgyan-gyi	’khor-lo	lnga
).
	
Buddha-activities

,	Skt.	
kṛtyakriyā
In	general,	it	is	said	that	the	principal	activity	of	the	
buddhas
	is	to	bring	about
the	 welfare	 of	 all	
sentient	 beings
,	 an	 aim	 which	 initially	 motivated	 their
aspiration	to	attain	the	fully	enlightened	state.	The	
Perfection	of	Discriminative
Awareness
	texts	enumerate	eighty	inexhaustible	buddha-activities,	while	some
commentarial	 treatises	 mention	 twenty-one	 enlightened	 activities	 of	 the
buddhas
.	With	respect	to	the	historical	
Buddha	Sākyamuni
,	the	Buddhist	texts
list	twelve	principal	deeds	that	exemplify	his	enlightened	activities.

CONFESSION	[IN	THE	PRESENCE]	OF	THE
INEXPRESSIBLE	TRUTH
HŪṂ	We	[aspiring]	awareness	holders,	who	are	heirs	to	the	compassionate
lineage,
Strive	to	cultivate	the	mind	of	enlightenment	for	the	sake	of	all	living	beings.
In	order	that	the	unsurpassed	state	may	be	attained,
We	have	repeatedly	received	and	earnestly	undertaken
[Both]	the	individual	disciplines	of	the	ocean-like	teachings,
5
And	 the	 supreme	 vows	 concordant	 with	 buddha-body,	 speech	 and	 mind,
including:
The	[appropriate]	commitments	of	[the	Vehicle	of]	Indestructible	Reality,
Which	are	dangerous	to	transgress,	and	must	be	constantly	maintained,
Together	with	all	the	general	and	particular	higher	commitments.
Yet,	 even	 though	 we	 strive	 neither	 to	 abandon	 nor	 to	 transgress	 [these
commitments],
And	we	strive	neither	to	deviate	from	the	truth	nor	to	allow	our	minds	to
fluctuate,
Since	 we	 idly	 think	 that	 we	 have	 the	 momentary	 luxury	 to	 sit	 back	 in
relaxation,
We	have	not	reached	fulfilment	and	our	mental	energy	has	been	faltering.
We	have	lacked	alertness,	and	have	been	overpowered	by	carelessness.
If,	therefore,	under	the	sway	of	ignorance,	consciously	or	unconsciously,
Our	meditation	has	lacked	perseverance,
And	we	have	been	distracted	in	our	ritual	service	and	means	for	attainment,
We	will	have	contradicted	the	injunctions	of	the	Teacher	and	contradicted	our
vows.
Further,	it	says	in	the	[Buddha’s]	scriptures:
‘A	 yogin	 should	 not	 associate,	 even	 for	 a	 moment,	 with	 one	 whose
commitments	have	degenerated.’
Not	being	[continuously]	cognisant	of	this,	we	have	transgressed	the	secret
approach	[of	the	tantras],
And	[consistently]	we	have	had	difficulty	discriminating	[between	worthy	and
unworthy	associates].
Lacking	supernormal	prescience,	we	have	failed	to	recognise	those	that	are
unworthy.

Thus,	now,	with	heartfelt	remorse,	we	confess	all	our	individual	faults,
Which	have	already	become	the	misfortunes	of	this	life	and	will	become	the
obscurations	of	future	lives.
Whatever	faults	of	degeneration	and	obscuration	have	tainted	us,
Whether	they	be	our	own	actual	degenerations	or	those	acquired	through
association	with	others	by:
Mixing	in	assemblies	with	those	whose	[commitments]	have	degenerated,
Repairing	[the	commitments	of]	those	who	have	degenerated,
Giving	the	[sacred]	teachings	to	those	who	are	degenerate	and	unworthy,
Or	by	committing	the	degenerate	fault	of	not	avoiding	[the	influence	of]	those
who	have	degenerated,	and	so	forth,
Do	not	permit	the	retribution	of	the	sublime	[protectors]	to	fall	upon	us!
Attend	to	us	with	the	compassion	of	your	loving	kindness!
And	make	us	secure,	so	that	we	never	stray	from	the	non-dual	expanse.
Having	inspired	us	to	abide	within	the	modality	of	non-referential	equanimity,
Please	grant	us	the	purity	of	the	non-dual	truth!
	
In	ultimate	truth,	inexpressible	and	without	conceptual	elaboration,
There	is	no	objective	referent	to	any	conceptual	thought	whatsoever.
But	if,	by	the	power	of	illusion-like	relative	appearances,	we	should	err,
[We	acknowledge	this	and	seek	your	forgiveness.]
We	confess	that	we	have	deviated	from	the	buddha-mind!
If	we	have	committed	transgressions,	please	forgive

Preliminary	Practices
	
sngon-’gro
The	preliminary	practices	are	those	undertaken	by	an	aspiring	practitioner	of	the
tantras
,	prior	to	engaging	in	the	main	practices	of	the	
generation
	and	
perfection
stages
	of	meditation.	There	are	both	outer,	or	common,	preliminaries,	and	inner,
or	uncommon,	preliminaries.	The	former	are	the	four	analytical	meditations
which	turn	the	mind	of	the	practitioner	away	from	worldly	distractions	and
towards	the	
sacred	teachings
,	namely	those	focusing:	on	the	nature	of	the
precious	opportunities	afforded	by	human	birth;	on	death	and	
impermanence
(
anitya
);	on	the	dynamics	of	
past	actions
	(
karma
)	and	their	consequences;	and
on	the	
sufferings
	of	beings	within	
cyclic	existence
	(
saṃsāra
).	The	latter	are	the
five	purificatory	practices,	each	of	which	is	performed	one	hundred	thousand
times,	 namely:	 the	 taking	 of	
refuge
	 in	 the	
Three	 Precious	 Jewels
,	 in
conjunction	with	the	act	of	
prostration
	(which	purifies	pride);	the	cultivation	of
the	 altruistic	 intention	 to	 attain	 enlightenment	 for	 the	 sake	 of	 others,	 in
conjunction	with	the	recitation	of	the	appropriate	verses	(which	purifies	envy
and	 mundane	 ambition);	 the	 recitation	 of	
Vajrasattva
’s	
Hundred-syllable
Mantra
	(which	purifies	
aversion
);	the	
offering
	of	the	
maṇḍala
	(which	purifies
attachment
);	and	the	cultivation	of	union	with	the	enlightened	attributes	of	the
spiritual	 teacher
	 (
guruyoga
),	 in	 conjunction	 with	 the	 appropriate	
mantra
recitation	(which	purifies	
delusion
).	See	Chapters	1	and	2.

ot	confess	[and	repair]	these	[degenerations]	fully,
One	will	experience	the	fierce	sufferings	of	the	hells.
In	order	for	the	confession	to	be	effective,	however,
You	should	perform	the	ritual	deception	pertaining	to	the	secret	[signs	of]
death,
Yet	[death]	will	be	harder	to	deceive	than	in	the	two	preceding	categories.
	
The	above	are	called	the	‘secret	signs	of	death’.
SIGNS	OF	REMOTE	DEATH
The	examination	of	the	signs	of	death	when	it	is	[still]	years	or	months	away
Should	be	made	by	scrutinising	the	‘shadow	of	one’s	lifespan’,
Optically	projected	onto	the	sky,	in	the	way	described	below.
[These	indications	may	show	that]	one	will	die,	or	that	one	will	not	die,
And	that	the	averting	[of	death]	will	be	possible,	or	impossible.
16
	
[To	begin],	offerings	should	be	made	to	the	spiritual	teacher,	and	the	Three

Precious	Jewels,
Torma
-offerings	should	be	presented	to	the	ḍākin
ῑ
s	and	protectors	of	the
[sacred]	teachings;
And	then,	after	going	for	refuge	and	offering	prayers,
The	examination	should	be	made	[as	follows]:
	
In	an	isolated	and	delightful	place,
In	the	morning	or	afternoon	of	the	first	day	of	the	month,
Or	in	the	evening	or	at	dawn	of	the	fifteenth	day,
17
When	the	sky	is	clear	and	there	is	no	wind,
One	should	sit	naked	in	a	comfortable	spot,
And	there,	after	praying	fervently,
One	should	repeat	the	following	mantra	one	hundred	times:
OṂ	ĀYUṢE	SAṂHĀRAKEŚVARE	HŪṂ	PHAṬ
18
Then,	standing	up,	naked,	one	should	bow	down	seven	times
To	each	of	the	gods	of	the	[ten]	directions,
And	then,	directly	stretching	out	one’s	four	limbs,
While	holding	in	one’s	hand	a	rosary	or	suitable	symbolic	hand-implement,
19
One	should	inscribe	the	letter	A	on	the	heart	of	one’s	shadow.
20
[Next],	without	blinking,	one	should	gaze	fixedly	at	the	letter	A	[drawn]	at	the
heart	[of	the	shadow],
And	focus	one’s	awareness	upon	[the	letter	A].
Then,	once	the	eyes	have	grown	numb	[through	strain],
One	should	look	up	into	the	centre	of	the	cloudless	sky,
At	which	time	one’s	own	form	should	become	visible	in	the	sky.
One	should	then	know	that	if	the	head	and	body	of	this	[reflected	image]	are
intact,	and	[the	image]	is	pale	in	colour,
This	is	an	auspicious	sign	that	there	will	be	no	obstacles	and	that	one	will	not
die	[imminently].
	
If	one’s	reflected	image	is	not	visible	in	the	sky,
[First],	perform	the	rite	for	affirmation	of	vows,
And,	while	sitting	in	the	‘indestructible	cross-legged	posture’,
With	the	hands	in	the	‘gesture	of	meditative	equipoise’,
21
Look	[for	the	image	again],	in	the	above	manner.

If	[one’s	reflected	image]	still	does	not	appear,
It	 may	 not	 be	 significant,	 as	 it	 may	 have	 been	 obscured	 by	 clouds	 or
atmospheric	winds,
In	which	case,	the	examination	should	be	postponed	until	the	sky	is	clear.
[When	the	reflected	image	does	become	visible,	however,]
Its	 examination	 entails	 three	 considerations:	 of	 completeness,	 shape,	 and
colour.
	
First,	 the	 completeness	 [of	 the	 reflected	 image]	 should	 be	 examined	 as
follows:
When	[assessing]	the	completeness	of	the	image
In	relation	to	the	number	of	years	[one	is	yet	to	live],
If	the	hand-held	implement	is	missing,
This	[indication]	is	called	the	‘separation	from	the	deity	on	whom	one	has
relied’,
22
And	it	indicates	that	one’s	life	may	end	in	seven	years’	time.
If	the	right	hand	is	missing,
[This	indicates	that]	one	may	die	after	five	years.
If	the	left	hand	is	missing,
[This	indicates	that]	one	may	die	after	three	years.
If	the	right	leg	is	missing	below	the	knee,
One	may	die	after	two	years.
If	the	left	leg	is	missing,
[This	indicates	that]	one	may	die	after	one	year.
	
Next,	when	[assessing]	the	completeness	[of	the	image]
In	relation	to	the	number	of	months	[one	is	yet	to	live]:
If	the	right	part	of	the	head	is	missing,
One	may	die	after	nine	months.
If	the	left	part	of	the	head	is	missing,
One	may	die	after	seven	months.
If	the	head	is	missing	above	the	neck,
One	may	die	after	five	months.
If	the	head	and	the	neck	are	both	missing,
One	may	die	after	three	mo

.	The	words	to	be	communicated	in	this	context	are	contained
below,	Ch.	11,	which	includes	descriptions	of	the	three	intermediate	states	of	the
time	of	death,	reality,	and	rebirth.	The	intermediate	state	of	reality	(
chos-nyid
bar-do
)	is	also	known	as	the	intermediate	state	of	inner	radiance	(
’od-gsal
	
),	on
which	see	Ch.	11,	p.	227ff.

Just	as	there	are	outer,	inner,	and	secret	signs	of	impending	death	(see	Ch.	8,
pp.	155-71)	and	outer	and	inner	signs	of	the	efficacy	of	the	mantras	utilised	in
‘liberation	by	wearing’	(see	Ch.	14,	
passim
),	so	here,	in	the	context	of	the
various	types	of	consciousness-transference,	there	are	‘outer’	signs	observable	in
the	atmosphere,	‘inner’	signs	observable	on	the	body	of	the	deceased,	and

‘secret’	signs	observable	in	the	relics	that	emerge	after	death.	On	the	appearance
of	seed-syllables	among	the	cremated	relics	of	great	spiritual	teachers,	see	
e.g.
Dudjom	Rinpoche,	NSTB,	p.	564.

The	white	syllable	ĀḤ	is	the	seed-syllable	of	Vajradhara,	the	azure	syllable
HŪṂ	is	that	of	Vajrasattva,	and	the	red	syllable	HRĪḤ	is	that	of	Avalokiteśvara.

The	five	types	of	bone-relic	(Tib.	
dung-rigs	rnam-pa-lnga
),	which	appear
following	cremation,	are	associated	with	the	five	seed-syllables	of	the	five	male
buddhas,	and	with	five	bodily	constituents.	See	Ch.	14.	On	the	appearance	of
cremation	relics	in	the	form	of	a	deity’s	hand-implement	(
phyag-mtshan
)	or
image	(
sku-’dra
),	see	
e.g.
	Dudjom	Rinpoche,	NSTB,	pp.	572.
27
	
Here	the	emergence	of	fluids	from	the	left	nostril	rather	than	the	crown
fontanelle	is	an	indication	that	the	consciousness-transference	has	taken	effect
into	the	Buddha-body	of	Emanation	rather	than	into	the	Buddha-bodies	of
Reality	or	Perfect	Resource.	On	the	appearance	of	such	signs,	see	Ch.	14,
passim
;	and	for	a	recorded	instance	of	the	whole	skull	being	left	as	a	cremation
relic,	see	Dudjom	Rinpoche,	NSTB,	p.	572.

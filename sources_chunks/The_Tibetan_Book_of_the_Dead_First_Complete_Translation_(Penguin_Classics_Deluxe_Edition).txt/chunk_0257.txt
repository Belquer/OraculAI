maṇḍala
	of	offerings	is	one	of	the	
preliminary	practices

Three	Buddha-bodies
	of	
emanation
,
perfect	resource

actual	reality
.	In	the	first,	the	entire	external	material
universe,	symbolised	by	Mount	
Sumeru
	and	the	
four	continents
,	etc.,	is	offered,
usually	using	a	circular	metal	base	on	which	are	arranged	small	heaps	of	rice;
second,	the	inner	
maṇḍala
	of	offerings	comprises	the	
subtle	body
,	complete
with	its	
energy	channels
,	currents	of	
vital	energy
	and	
seminal	points
;	and,
third,	the	secret	
maṇḍala
	of	offerings	is	that	of	
actualreality
	or	the	ultimate
nature	of	
mind
.	In	the	
preliminary	practices
	all	these	are	offered	one	hundred
thousand	times	as	an	antidote	for	
attachment

’jam-dpal

ῑ
	 is	 the	 embodiment	 of	 the	
discriminative	 awareness
	 of	 all	 the
buddhas
,	manifesting	in	the	form	of	a	
meditational	deity
.	He	is	normally
depicted	in	his	seated	posture,	holding	a	sword	in	his	right	hand	(representing
discriminative	awareness
)	and	a	sacred	text	in	his	left	hand	(indicating	his
mastery	of	all	knowledge).	
Mañjuśr
ῑ

figure	who	was	one	of	the	eight	principal	
bodhisattva
	disciples	of	the	
Buddha
;
and	he	is	also	one	of	the	four	outer	male	
bodhisattvas

Mantra
	
sngags
The	Sanskrit	word	
mantra
	is	an	abbreviation	of	two	syllables	
mana
	and	
traya
,
respectively	meaning	‘mind’	and	‘protection’.	Hence	‘
mantra
’	literally	refers	to

‘protection	of	the	mind’.	The	essential	indication	here	is	the	protection	of	the
mind	from	the	overwhelming	influence	of	ordinary	perceptions	and	conceptions,
which	give	rise	to	deluded	states	of	existence,	thus	inhibiting	the	full	expression
of	
buddha	nature
.	More	specifically,	
mantra
	refers	to	the	pure	sound	which	is
the	perfected	speech	of	an	
enlightened
	being.	The	aim	of	the	
generation	stage
practices	is	the	cultivation	of	the	mode	of	being	of	the	
meditational	deity
,	that
is	to	say	the	transformation	of	mundane	body,	speech	and	mind	into	
buddha-
body
,	
speech
	and	
mind
.	This	is	supported	in	ritual	practice	by	the	enactment	of
the	hand-gestures	or	
seal
	(
mudrā
),	which	are	the	resonance	of	
buddha-body
,	by
mantra
	 recitation,	 which	 is	 the	 resonance	 of	
buddha-speech
,	 and	 by
visualisation,	which	is	the	resonance	of	
buddha-mind
.	In	general,	three	types	of
mantra
	 are	 differentiated:	
mantras
	 of	
retention	 (Skt.	
dhāraṇ
ῑ
,	 Tib.	
gzungs-
sngags
),	 gnostic	
mantras
	 (Skt.	
vidyāmantra
,	 Tib.	
rig-sngags
),	 and	 secret
mantras
	 (Skt.	
guhyamantra
,	 Tib.	
gsang-sngags
).	 Among	 these,	 the	 first
comprises	the	
mantras
	associated	with	the	
sūtras
	which	are	designed	to	intensify
discriminative	awareness
,	the	second	are	associated	with	specific	deities	of	the
outer	
tantras
,	 and	 designed	 to	 intensify	
skilful	means
,	 while	 the	 third	 are
associated	with	the	inner	
tantras
,	and	are	designed	to	intensify	the	
generation
stage
	
of	meditation.	The	term	‘secret	
mantra
’	is	also	utilised	as	a	synonym	for
the	
Vehicle	of	Indestructible	Reality
	(
Vajrayāna
).
	
Mantrin
	
sngags-pa
An	adept	of	the	vehicle	of	secret	
mantra
	
(
mantrayāna
)	in	general.	However,	the
word	
ngakpa
	(
sngags-pa
)	is	popularly	used	to	denote	those	practitioners	of
tantra
	
who	choose	to	maintain	a	family	life,	passing	on	their	teachings	through	a
familial	lineage,	in	contrast	to	the	celibate	life	of	a	monk	or	nun.

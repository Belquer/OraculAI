which	obscure	the	perception	of

bodhisattva
	 path,	 thirty-seven	 distinct	 aspects	 of
enlightenment	are	sequentially	cultivated.	A	fully	enlightened	being	is	a	
buddha
who	is	totally	free	from	all	obstruction	to	true	knowledge	and	the	state	of
liberation

omniscient

Envy

ῑ
rṣā
Envy,	which	includes	all	the	various	forms	of	self-cherishing	ambition,	is	one	of
the	
five	poisons
	of	the	mind	(
dug-lnga
),	along	with	
aversion
,	
delusion
,	pride,
and	
attachment
.	 In	 its	 extreme	 manifestation,	 of	 persistent	 hostile
competitiveness,	it	is	said	to	characterise	the	worlds	of	the	
antigods
	(
asuraloka
).
	
Equanimity
	
btang-snyoms
,	Skt.	
upekṣā
Equanimity	is	one	of	the	
four	immeasurable	aspirations
,	along	with	
loving
kindness
,	
compassion
	 and	 empathetic	 joy,	 which	 are	 cultivated	 in	 the
preliminary	 practices
	
and	 commonly	 repeated	 before	 engaging	 in	 daily
practice.	Equanimity	is	an	essential	element	of	the	cultivation	of	the	
altruistic
intention	to	attain	enlightenment
	for	the	benefit	of	others,	in	the	context	of
which	 the	 practitioner	 cultivates	 an	 unbiased	 attitude	 towards	 all	
sentient
beings
,	regarding	them	as	being	completely	equal	and	thus	overcoming	any
sense	of	partiality	towards	them.	Normally	one’s	attitude	towards	other	persons,
for	 example,	 is	 strongly	 prejudiced	 by	 one’s	 classification	 of	 others	 into
seemingly	 incompatible	 groups	 of	 friends,	 enemies	 or	 those	 regarded	 with
indifference.	See	also	under

In	the	terminology	of	the	
Great	Perfection
,	the	essence	(
ngo-bo
)	is	the	modality
of	the	
Buddha-body	of	Reality
,	natural	expression	(
rang-bzhin
)	is	the	modality
of	 the	
Buddha-body	 of	 Perfect	 Resource
,	 and	 compassionate	 energy	 or
spirituality	(
thugs-rje
)	 is	 the	 modality	 of	 the	
Buddha-body	 of	 Emanation
.
These	three	modalities	may	be	cultivated	through	the	techniques	known	as
Cutting	 through	 Resistance
	
(
khregs-chod
)	 and	
All-supassing	 Realisation
(
thod-rgal
	 ).	 The	 term	
natural	 expression
	 (
rang-bzhin
)	 also	 has	 another
distinctive	usage	in	the	context	of	the	present	work,	where	it	frequently	refers	to
the	attributes	represented	by	the	twenty-eight	
Īśvar

Eternalist
	
mu-stegs-pa

ῑ
rthika
In	general	Buddhist	usage,	the	term	‘eternalist’	refers	to	the	four	so-called
eternalistic	schools	of	ancient	India,	namely	
Sāṃkhya
,	Vaishnavism,	Shaivism
and	Jainism,	which	posit	the	existence	of	an	independent	self	or	soul	(
ātman
,
Tib.	
bdag
).	By	contrast,	Buddhist	schools	identify	the	self	in	terms	of	the	five
psycho-physical	
aggregates
	(
pañcaskandha
),	and	therefore	do	not	accept	the
notion	of	self	in	the	sense	of	an	eternal,	unchanging,	independently	existing
entity.	Both	eternalism	and	
nihilism
	are	regarded	as	the	two	extreme	views,
which	are	to	be	avoided	when	seeking	an	insight	into	
emptiness
,	the	true	nature
of	
reality
,	 by	 means	 of	 the	
Middle	 Way
	 (
madhyamapratipad
).	 Here	 all
apprehensions	 of	
inherent	 existence
	 constitute	 falling	 into	 the	 extreme	 of
eternalism,	and	a	total	denial	of	the	laws	of	
cause	and	effect
	in	association	with
past	and	future	lives	constitutes	falling	into	nihilism.
	
Expanse	of	[Actual]	Reality

The	expanse	of	actual	reality	is	a	synonym	for	the	expanse	of	
emptiness
.	As
such,	
it	indicates	both	the	dimension	of	the	
Buddha-body	of	Reality
,	and	the
pristine	cognition
	of	
reality’s	expanse
	(
dharmadhātujñāna
).

ortant.	Again	and	again,	do	not	be
distracted.
	
If	[the	deceased]	does	indeed	recognise	this	essential	nature	[of	reality],	he	or
she	will	attain	liberation	and	avoid	roaming	further	amongst	the	six	classes	[of
beings].	But,	on	account	of	negative	past	actions,	recognition	is	not	easy	to
achieve,	and	therefore,	one	should	reiterate	[the	introduction],	in	the	following
words:
	
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	listen	[carefully]	yet	again!	The	phrase,	‘Complete
with	all	sense-faculties,	and	the	power	of	unobstructed	movement’
6
	
means	that,
even	though	you	may	have	been	blind,	deaf	or	lame	while	you	were	alive,	now,	in
the	intermediate	state,	your	eyes	see	forms,	your	ears	hear	sounds	and	all	your
sense-faculties	 are	 faultless,	 clear	 and	 complete.	 Hence	 [the	 tantra]	 says
‘complete	with	all	sense	faculties’.	Recognise	this	[sensory	clarity],	for	it	is	a
sign	that	you	have	died	and	are	wandering	in	the	intermediate	state.	Remember
this	oral	instruction!	O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	‘unobstructed’	means	that	the
body	which	you	now	have	is	a	mental	body.	Your	awareness	is	now	separated
from	 its	 physical	 support.	 Therefore,	 this	 is	 not	 a	 body	 of	 solid	 form.
Accordingly,	you	now	have	the	ability	to	move	unobstructedly;	penetrating	to	the
core	of	all	forms,	you	can	pass	through	Mount	Sumeru,	and	through	dwellings,
the	earth,	stones,	boulders	and	mountains.	Indeed,	other	than	your	mother’s
womb	and	the	‘Indestructible	Seat’,
7
	
you	can	pass	back	and	forth	even	through
Mount	Sumeru	itself.	Remember	the	advice	of	your	spiritual	teacher	-	for	
this
[ability]	is	a	sign	that	you	are	wandering	in	the	intermediate	state	of	rebirth.
[Recognise	this]	and	pray	to	the	meditational	deity	Mahākāruṇika.
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	the	phrase	‘endowed	with	miraculous	abilities
derived	from	past	actions’
8
	
does	not	mean	that	you	necessarily	possess	any
enlightened	attributes,	or	any	miraculous	ability	in	meditative	stability,	but	that
you	have	a	miraculous	ability	which	results	from	your	past	actions	and	accords

with	 your	 past	 actions.
9
	
[Consequently],	 you	 will	 have	 the	 ability	 to
circumambulate	Mount	Sumeru	and	the	four	continents,	in	an	instant.	Merely	in
the	time	it	takes	to	withdraw	or	hold	out	an	arm,	you	can	travel	instantly
anywhere	you	wish,	just	by	thinking	of	your	desired	destination.	Do	not	be
fascinated	by	these	diverse	and	haphazard	miraculous	abilities.	Do	not	indulge
in	them.	Of	all	the	things	which	you	have	the	ability	to	recall,	there	is	not	one
which	you	cannot	make	manifest.	You	have	the	ability	now,	to	manifest	[any
aspect	of	your	past],	unimpededly.	Therefore	recognise	this	and	pray	to	your
spiritual	teacher.
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	as	for	the	phrase	‘visible	to	those	similar	in	kind
and	through	pure	clairvoyance’,
10
	
the	words	‘similar	in	kind’	mean	that	in	the
intermediate	state,	those	of	a	similar	kind	of	birth	will	come	to	perceive	one
another.	Thus,	in	the	case	of	those	‘similar	in	kind’	who	are	to	be	born	as	gods,
the	gods	[to	be]	perceive	one	another.	Similarly,	those	that	are	‘similar	in	kind’
to	any	of	the	six	classes	[of	beings],	will	come	to	perceive	one	another.	Do	not
become	attached	[at	the	sight	of	these	beings]!	Meditate	on	[the	meditational
deity]	Mahākāruṇika.	The	words	‘visible	through	pure	clairvoyance’	do	not	refer
to	the	[clairvoyance]	which	results	from	the	meritorious	qualities	of	the	gods
and	so	forth,	but	they	do	refer	to	the	pure	clairvoyance	with	which	those	of
genuine	 meditative	 concentration	 perceive.
11
	
However,	 this	 is	 not	 [a
clairvoyance]	that	can	perceive	[the	beings	of	the	intermediate	state]	at	all
times.	If	you	are	intent	on	seeing	[beings	of	like	nature	in	this	intermediate	state]
then	they	will	be	perceived.	If	you	are	not	so	intent,	they	will	not	be	perceived.
This	[clairvoyance]	will	dissolve,	as	soon	as	your	concentration	is	distracted.
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	with	a	body	having	qualities	such	as	these	just
described,	you	will	[once	again]	see

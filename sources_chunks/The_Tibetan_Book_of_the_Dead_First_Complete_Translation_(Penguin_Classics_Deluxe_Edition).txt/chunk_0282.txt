taught	 publicly	 to	 his
disciples	 as	 a	 fully	 ordained	 monk,	 consequent	 to	 his	 attainment	 of
buddhahood
.	In	the	context	of	the	three	successive	
turnings	of	the	wheel	of
the	sacred	teachings
,	the	
Buddha
	expounded	respectively	1)	the	discourses	on
the	doctrine	of	the	
four	noble	truths
	(Skt
.	caturāryasatya
),	2)	the	
Perfection	of
Discriminative	Awareness
	(
Prajñāpāramitā
	
),	
Ratnakūṭa
	 and	 related	
sūtras
which	emphasise	
signlessness
,	aspirationlessness	and	
emptiness
,	and	3)	the
Nucleus	of	the	Tathāgata
	(
Tathāgatagarbha
)	and	related	
sūtras,
	as	well	as	the
Sūtra	 of	 the	 Unravelling	 of	 Enlightened	 Intention
	
(
Sandhinirmocanasūtra
),

which	 emphasise	
buddha	 nature
	 and	 the	 thorough	 analysis	 of	
buddha
attributes
.	Among	these	the	first	category	is	the	corpus	of	the	
Lesser	Vehicle
sūtras
	 and	 the	 last	 two	 are	 the	
Greater	 Vehicle
	
sūtras
.	 The	 scriptural
transmissions
	of	the	
sacred	teachings
	of	Buddhism	comprise	the	canonical
sūtras
	
and	
tantras
,	as	well	as	their	commentarial	literature.
	
Sūtrayāna
	
mdo-sde’i	theg-pa
A	 term	 referring	 collectively	 to	 the	 first	 three	 of	 the	
nine	 vehicles
	 when
contrasted	with	the	six	vehicles	of	the	
tantras
.	See	also	under	
Greater	Vehicle
.
	
Symbolic	Lineage	of	Awareness	Holders
	
rig-’dzin	brda’i	brgyud-pa
The	
lineage
	through	which	non-human	and	human	
awareness	holders
	of	the
highest	
spiritual	accomplishments
	 symbolically	 receive	 the	 teachings	 from
bodhisattvas
	
of	the	tenth	level.	More	specifically,	this	refers	to	the	
transmission
of	advanced	
bodhisattvas
	such	as	
Mañjuśr
ῑ
,	
Avalokiteśvara
,	and	
Vajrapāṇi
	who
communicated	with	their	respective	disciples	(
gods
,	
serpentine	water	spirits
and	
mountain	or	sylvan	spirits
)	by	means	of	symbolic	gestures	rather	than
words.	It	also	refers	to	the	mode	in	which	the	earliest	human	progenitors	of	the
Atiyoga
	
lineage
	received	and	transmitted	their	highest	teachings.
	
Tantra
	
rgyud
The	Sanskrit	word	
tantra
	and	its	Tibetan	equivalent	
rgyud
	literally	mean	a
‘continuum’	 or	 ‘unbroken	 stream’	 flowing	 from	
fundamental	ignorance
	 to
enlightenment
	
.	
Tantra
	has	two	basic	meanings	in	Buddhism	-	it	refers	to	the
continua	of	ground,	path	and	result
,	and	to	the	literature	or	
tantra
	texts	which
expound	these	continua	in	the	context	of	the	classes	of	
tantra
	(see	below).	The
former	is	the	
actual	meaning	of	
tantra
.	Through	the	
continuum	of	the	path
(
lam-gyi	rgyud
)	 the	 primordially	 present	
continuum	 of	 the	 ground
	 (
gzhi’i
rgyud
)	is	realised	or	fully	manifested	as	the	
continuum	of	the	result
	(
’bras-bu’i
rgyud
).	Because	
tantra
	includes	sophisticated	techniques	which,	unlike	the	
sūtra
path,	 enable	 dissonant	 mental	 states,	 such	 as	 desire/
attachment
	 and
hatred/
aversion
,	to	be	transmuted	into	states	of	
realisation
,	without	renunciation
or	rejection,	the	practitioner	can	cultivate	an	uninterrupted	continuum	between
the	practitioner’s	ordinary	initial	mind,	the	advanced	mind	on	the	path,	and	the
resultant	fully	
enlightened	mind
	of	the	
Buddha
.	In	the	
Nyingma
	school	the
literature	which	expounds	this	dynamic	is	divided	into	a	sixfold	classification	of
the	three	outer	
tantras
,	namely:	
Kriyātantra
,	
Ubhayatantra
	
,	and	
Yogatantra
,

and	the	three	inner	
tantras
,	namely:	
Mahāyoga
,	
Anuyoga
	and	
Atiyoga
.	These
six	classes	represent	stages	of	ever-decreasing	emphasis	on	external	ritual	and
ever-increasing	subtlety	of	internal	
meditation
	together	with	an	ever-increasing
subtlety	of	the	
dissonant	mental	states
,	attachment	in	particular,	that	can	be
transformed	into	a	blissful	experience	conjoined	with	the	
realisation
	of	the
actual	nature	of	
reality
.	It	is	said	that	on	the	basis	of	the	fulfilment	of	the
generation
	 and	
perfection	stages
	 of	 the	 three	 inner	
tantras
	 fully	 manifest
buddhahood
	can	be	attained	in	a	single	lifetime.

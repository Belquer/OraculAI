which	swirl
around	you.	[Frightened],	you	will	set	off	to	seek	a	refuge	and	you	will	find
protection	inside	an	enclosed	space,	such	as	within	the	mansions,	just	described,
or	in	rock-shelters,	or	holes	in	the	ground,	or	amongst	trees,	or	within	the	bud	of
a	lotus	flower.	Hiding	here,	you	will	be	very	hesitant	to	come	out,	and	you	will
think:	‘I	should	not	leave	here	now.’	You	will	be	very	reluctant	to	be	separated
from	this	protected	place	and	you	will	become	utterly	attached	to	it.	Then,
because	you	are	so	very	hesitant	to	go	outside,	where	you	would	be	confronted
by	the	fears	and	terrors	of	the	intermediate	state,	you	will,	because	of	this	fear
and	awe,	continue	to	hide	away.	Thus,	you	will	assume	a	body,	however	utterly
bad	that	may	be,	and	you	will,	[in	time],	come	to	experience	all	manner	of
sufferings.	This	[experience	of	wanting	to	hide]	is	a	sign	that	you	are	being
obstructed	by	malignant	forces	and	carnivorous	ogres.	Particularly	related	to
this	stage,	there	is	a	profound	oral	instruction.	Listen,	therefore,	and	understand!
At	this	time,	when	you	are	being	pursued	by	avenging	forces	and	you	feel
powerless	[to	escape]	and	you	are	terrified	and	frightened,	you	must,	in	an
instant	 and	 with	 perfect	 recall,	 visualise	 the	 Transcendent	 Lord	 Mahottara
Heruka,	or	Hayagr
ῑ
va,	or	Vajrapāṇi,	or	else,	if	you	have	one,	your	personal
meditational	deity.	[Visualise	the	deity]	as	having	a	huge	buddha-body,	with
thick	 limbs,	 standing	 upright,	 in	 a	 terrifying	 wrathful	 manifestation,	 which
pulverises	every	form	of	obstructing	force.	[By	virtue	of	this	practice],	insulated
from	the	avengers	by	the	blessing	and	compassion	[of	the	meditational	deity],
you	will	secure	the	ability	to	choose	a	womb	entrance.	This	is	a	profound	and
genuine	crucial	point	of	the	oral	instructions.	So,	understand	this	now!
Moreover,	O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	the	gods	[inhabiting	the	form	realms]
of	meditative	concentration,	and	similar	beings	[of	the	higher	realms],	take	birth

through	 the	 potency	 of	 their	 meditative	 stability.

Also,	 certain	 classes	 of
malevolent	forces,	including	the	anguished	spirits,	arise	on	the	basis	of	the
transformation	of	their	mental	body	itself	during	this	very	[intermediate	state],
through	a	shift	in	their	mode	of	perception.	[In	this	way],	they	assume	the	forms
of	an	anguished	spirit,	malign	force	or	carnivorous	ogre,	capable	of	displaying
diverse	miraculous	acts.	The	anguished	spirits	who	reside	in	the	ocean	depths,
the	anguished	spirits	who	move	through	space,	the	eighty	thousand	classes	of
obstructing	forces,	and	so	forth,	all	come	into	existence	consequent	on	such	a
shift	in	their	mode	of	perception,	while	[still]	in	the	mental	body.
At	this	time,	therefore,	[while	visualising	the	wrathful	deity]	it	is	essential	that
you	hold	in	mind	the	meaning	of	emptiness,	[the	essence	of]	the	Great	Seal.	If
you	are	not	able	to	practise	in	this	way,	you	must	cultivate	your	experience	of	the
illusion-like	natural	expressive	power	[of	actual	reality].	If	you	are	unable	even
to	 practise	 in	 that	 way,	 you	 should	 meditate	 on	 the	 meditational	 deity
Mahākāruṇika,	without	allowing	your	mind	to	experience	attachment,	in	any
respect	whatsoever.	Through	[practising	this	effectively],	buddhahood	will	be
attained	in	the	Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource,	during	this	intermediate	state.
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	if,	due	to	the	potency	of	your	past	actions,	you
must	at	this	stage	enter	a	womb,	a	further	teaching	on	the	methods	of	choosing	a
womb	entrance	is	now	to	be	taught.	Listen,	[carefully],	therefore!	Do	not	just
move	towards	whatever	womb	entrance	appears	to	you.	If,	whilst	being	pursued
by	the	avenging	forces	[of	the	laws	of	cause	and	effect],	you	are	powerless	[and
unable	to	resist]	the	process	of	entering	[a	womb],	then	you	must,	at	this	time,
meditate	on	Hayagr
ῑ
va.	Since	you	now	possess	a	subtle	supernormal	cognitive
ability,	you	will	[clearly]	apprehend	all	the	[potential]	birthplaces	as	they	arise,
in	s

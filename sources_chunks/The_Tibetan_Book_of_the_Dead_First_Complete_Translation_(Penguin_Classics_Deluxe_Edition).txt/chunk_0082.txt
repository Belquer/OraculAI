ment’,
And	it	indicates	that	one	may	die	after	nine	days.
	
[Further],	if,	when	the	[closed]	eyes	are	pressed,	no	circles	of	light	appear,
This	is	called	the	‘setting	of	the	unchanging	sun	at	the	summit	of	Mount
Sumeru’,
28
And	it	indicates	that	one	may	die	after	three	or	seven	days.
[Further],	if,	when	the	ears	are	cupped	with	the	fingers,
The	humming	sound	which	is	[normally]	present	is	absent,
This	is	called	the	‘interruption	of	the	natural	sound	of	the	ḍākin
ῑ
s	from	within
Mount	Sumeru’,
29
And	it	indicates	that	one	may	die	after	seven	or	thirteen	days.
	
[Alternatively],	on	a	morning	when	the	sun	is	shining,
One	should	turn	one’s	back	to	the	sun,
And	if	no	evaporation	[is	seen	to]	rise	from	the	crown	of	one’s	shadow,
This	is	called	the	‘rupturing	of	the	Wish-granting	Tree	from	the	Summit	of
Mount	Sumeru’,
30
And	it	indicates	that	one	may	die	after	five	days.
	
[Also],	if	a	single	tuft	of	hair	exceptionally	rises	upwards	from	the	posterior
fontanelles,
This	is	called	‘the	black	lord	of	death,	one-legged	Yavati,	arising	as	an	enemy
against	the	Wish-granting	Tree’,
31
And	it	indicates	that	one	may	die	after	seven	days.
	
Whichever	of	these	[signs	of]	death	occur,

They	indicate	the	specific	time-frame	[of	impending	death].
Therefore,	upon	the	occurrence	of	such	[signs],	the	
Ritual	Deception	of	Death
should	be	performed	three	times.
If	this	is	carried	out	[successfully],	untimely	death	will	be	averted.
One	should	[therefore]	exert	oneself	and	persevere	in	[applying]	the	practical
instructions,
As	[taught]	in	the	
Natural	Liberation	of	Fear	through	the	Ritual	Deception	of
Death
.
But	if	the	ritual	deception	does	not	take	effect,
Despite	being	performed	on	three	occasions,
Death	is	definite,	for	one’s	lifespan	is	at	its	end.
MISCELLANEOUS	SIGNS	OF	DEATH
32
Here	follows	the	presentation	of	the	miscellaneous	signs	of	death.
Regardless	of	whether	one	is	sick	or	healthy,
If	one	cannot	see	the	point	of	the	nose	with	the	eyes,
One	may	die	after	five	months.
If	one	cannot	see	the	tip	of	one’s	own	tongue,
One	may	die	after	three	days	even	if	one	is	not	sick.
If,	when	one	gazes	at	the	surface	of	a	clear	mirror,
One	cannot	see	with	one’s	left	eye,	one	may	die	after	seven	months.
[Usually],	when	one	breathes	into	the	palm	of	one’s	own	hand	[from	close
by],	it	will	feel	warm,
And	when	one	does	so	[from	a	distance]	it	will	feel	cold,
But	if	these	[sensations]	are	reversed,
One	should	know	that	one	might	die	after	ten	days.
If,	when	one	looks	for	one’s	reflection	in	a	vessel	filled	with	water,
No	reflections,	images,	or	the	like,	are	apparent,
This	too	is	a	sign	of	death.
If,	when	bathing,	water	does	not	cling	to	the	area	around	the	heart,
Or	if	the	water	dries	out	[quickly]	around	the	heart,	this	may	indicate	death.
It	is	[also]	said	that	if	no	sound	is	emitted	when	one	snaps	the	fingers,	this
may	indicate	death;
And	if	the	anklebones	protrude	from	the	legs,

It	is	said	that	one	may	die	after	one	month.
	
[Furthermore],	it	is	said	that	if	one	leaves	no	footprints	in	soft	earth,	this	may
indicate	death,
And	if	one	becomes	weaker	after	having	eaten	nutritious	food,
And	if	one’s	shadow	changes	[its	shape	unnaturally],	this	too	may	indicate
death.
	
When	lice	and	nits	[suddenly]	gather	or	leave,	this	may	indicate	death.
If	a	former	temperament,	peaceful	or	wrathful,	is	reversed,
And	if	a	former	pattern	of	behaviour,	good	or	bad,	changes,
These	too	are	signs	indicative	of	a	person’s	death.
If	one’s	image	reflected	in	water	or	in	a	mirror	lacks	a	head	or	limbs,
This	too	may	be	a	sign	of	death.
If	there	is	a	retraction	of	the	penis	and	protrusion	of	the	testicles,	or	vice	versa,
If	a	previously	unheard	pulmonary	wheezing	sound	occurs,
And	if	one	cannot	sense	the	smell	of	a	dying	butter	lamp,
These	are	said	to	be	signs	that	one	will	certainly	die	[imminently].
	
In	addition	to	such	signs,	the	following	may	also	occur:
A	turbid	confusion	and	darkening	of	normal	consciousness,
A	loss	of	one’s	former	appetite,
Embarrassment	and	incapacity	in	underta

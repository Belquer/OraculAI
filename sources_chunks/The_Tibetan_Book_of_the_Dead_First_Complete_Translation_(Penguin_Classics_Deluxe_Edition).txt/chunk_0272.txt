accomplished
masters
	who	have	attained	proficiency	in	
consciousness	transference
,	which

The	consciousness	of	the	harmful	being	is	compassionately	transferred	to	a
realm	of	higher	rebirth	thus	freeing	him	or	her	from	the	inevitable	consequences
of	their	future	and	
past	actions

Rudra
	
ru-dra
As	expounded,	for	example,	in	the	
Sūtra	which	Gathers	All	Intentions
	(
mDo
dgongs-pa	’dus-pa
)	and	later	
treasure
	(
gter-ma
)	revelations	as	well,	
Rudra
	is	the
embodiment	of	rampant	egohood,	a	being	who	assumed	a	powerful	malevolent
form,	having	misapplied	the	practice	of	the	
tantras
	in	a	previous	life,	and	who
was	consequently	subdued	by	the	
wrathful
	means	of	the	
buddhas
	
Hayagr
ῑ
va
	or
Mahottara	Heruka
.	The	metaphor	illustrates	the	origins	of	the	outer	attributes	of

the	
wrathful	deities
,	who	are	in	essence	the	
peaceful	deities
,	but	who	adopted
the	outer	terrifying	characteristics	of	
Rudra
	in	order	to	actively	confront	deep-
seated	egohood.	The	metaphor	illustrates	that	the	
wrathful	deities
	represent	the
spontaneous	process	of	transformation	of	the	outer	deluded	state	to	its	actual	or
enlightened	nature.
	
Sacred	Substances
	
rdzas

According	to	the	
tantras
,	ritual	substances	or	articles	are	employed	in	order	to
symbolise	the	bond	between	the	practitioner	and	the	
meditational	deity
	and	in
some	cases	these	actually	symbolise	the	
meditational	deities
	or	their	attributes.
In	the	context	of	an	
empowerment
	ceremony,	symbolic	implements,	such	as	the
vajra
	and	bell,	or	diadem,	vase	and	so	on	are	known	as	sacred	substances	of

[Sacred]	Teachings
	
[dam-pa’i]	chos
,	Skt.	
[sad]dharma
The	Sanskrit	term	
dharma
	carries	a	very	broad	range	of	meanings,	derived	from
the	Sanskrit	word	
dhṛ
,	meaning	‘to	hold’.	The	Tibetan	equivalent	
chos
	literally
means	‘change’	or	‘transformation’,	and	refers	both	to	the	process	of	spiritual
transformation	and	to	the	transformed	result.	Ten	classical	definitions	of	
dharma
are	given	
by	
Vasubandhu
	in	his	
Rational	System	of	Exposition
	(
Vyākhyāyukti
),
namely:	 phenomenon,	 path	 leading	 to	 enlightenment,	 attainment	 of
enlightenment,	object	of	consciousness,	merit,	living	thing,	scripture,	material
thing,	regulation,	and	spiritual	tradition.	In	terms	of	the	spiritual	tradition	of
Buddhism,	the	term	refers	specifically	to	the	second	of	the	
Three	Precious
Jewels
	(Skt.	
triratna
),	
i.e.
	to	the	sacred	teachings.	See

Sakya
	
sa-skya
One	of	the	four	principal	schools	of	Tibetan	Buddhism,	named	after	a	monastery
of	the	same	name	which	was	founded	by	
Khon	Konchok	Gyalpo
	in	the	eleventh
century	in	western	Tibet,	at	a	site	which	has	a	slightly	whitish	rock	surface.
Sakya
	
literally	means	‘pale	earth’.	The	widespread	influence	of	the	early	
Sakya
masters	soon	evolved	into	a	whole	new	school	of	Tibetan	Buddhism,	the	school
reaching	its	full	maturity	during	the	time	of	the	
Sachen	Gongma	Nga
,	the	five
great	founders	of	
Sakya
,	and	in	particular	through	the	influence	of	perhaps	the
greatest	of	these,

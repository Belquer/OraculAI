respectively	entail	1)

recitation	and	one-pointed	visualisation	of	the

blessing
	of	the	deity	will	descend	to

,	3)	the	absorption	of	accomplishments	from	the	actual	deity	into	the
visualised	deity	and	thence	into	oneself,	and	4)	the	realisation	of	
primordial
purity
	experienced	when	body,	speech	and	mind	are	identical	to	those	of	the
deity.

Four	Continents	and	Eight	Subcontinents
	
gling	bzhi-dang	gling-phran	brgyad
According	 to	 traditional	 Indian	 Buddhist	 cosmology,	 the	 world	 has	
Mount
Sumeru
	
as	its	central	axis,	surrounded	by	seven	concentric	oceans	divided	from
one	 another	 by	 seven	 successive	 ranges	 of	 golden	 mountains:	
Yugandhara
,
Isadhāra
,	
Khadirika
,	
Sudarśana
,	
Aṣvakarna
,	
Vinataka
,	and	
Nimindhara
.	The
entire	world	is	girded	by	a	perimeter	of	iron	mountains	known	as	the	
Cakravāla
.
In	each	of	the	four	cardinal	directions	of	
Mount
	
Sumeru
,	there	is	located	a
continent,	along	with	two	satellites	or	subcontinents.	Among	these,	the	eastern
continent	
Viratdeha
	(
lus-’phags
;	‘sublime	in	body’)	is	semicircular	and	it	has
two	subcontinents:	
Deha
	(
lus
)	and	
Videha
	
(
lus-’phags
).	The	southern	continent
Jambudv
ῑ
pa
	(
’dzam-bu	gling
;	‘rose-apple	continent’)	is	triangular	and	its	two
subcontinents	are	
Cāmaradv
ῑ
pa
	(
rnga-yab	gling
)	and	
Aparacāmara
	(
rnga-yab
gzhan
).	The	western	continent,	
Aparagodan
ῑ
ya
	(
balang	
spyod
;	‘rich	in	cattle’),	is
circular	and	its	two	subcontinents	are	
Śāṭhā
	(
gYo-ldan
)	 and	
Uttaramantriṇa
(
lam-mchog	’gro
).	Lastly,	the	northern	continent	
Uttarakuru
	
(
sgra-mi-snyan
;
‘unpleasant	sound’)	is	square	and	its	two	subcontinents	are	
Kurava
	
(
sgra	mi-
snyan
)	and	
Kaurava	(sgra	mi-snyan-gyi	zla
).	Among	the	four,	
Jambudv
ῑ
pa
	
is
unique	in	that	it	is	here	that	the	
sacred	teachings
	of	the	
buddhas
	are	said	to
flourish.	See	Chapter	11,	Part	Three	with	respect	to	instructions	for	choosing	a
birthplace	and	Chapter	1	with	respect	to	visualising	the	
maṇḍala
	
of	offerings

Four	Delights
	
dga’-ba	bzhi
In	the	
perfection	stage
	(
sampannakrama
)	of	meditation,	when	the	practices	of
sexual	yoga	(
sbyor-ba
)	are	applied	in	order	to	bring	about	a	coalescence	of	bliss
and	
emptiness
,	the	
generative	essence
	(
thig-le
)	of	the	body	descends	through
the	
central	channel
	and	the	four	delights	are	sequentially	experienced.	As	it
descends	from	the	
energy	centre
	of	the	crown	fontanelle	to	the	throat	centre,	the
pristine	cognition
	of	delight	(
dga’-ba
)	is	experienced.	When	it	descends	from
the	throat	centre	to	the	heart	centre,	the	
pristine	cognition
	of	supreme	delight
(
mchog-dga’
)	is	experienced.	When	it	descends	from	the	heart	centre	to	the
navel	centre	the	
pristine	cognition
	of	the	absence	of	delight	(
dga’-bral
)	is

experienced.	And	when	it	descends	from	the	navel	centre	to	the	secret	centre	of
the	 genitalia,	 the	
coemergent	 delight
	 (
lhan-skyes	 dga’-ba
)	 is	 experienced.
Thereafter,	 the	
generative	 essence
	 is	 retained	 within	 the	 body	 and	 drawn
upwards	through	the	central	channel,	permeating	each	of	the	
energy	centres
	of
the	body	in	turn	with	unceasing	bliss	and	non-conceptual	
pristine	cognition
.	See

Coemergent	Delight

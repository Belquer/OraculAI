ive-coloured	lights.	All	the	male	bodhisattvas	of	the	[five]	enlightened
families	who	accompany	the	male	[buddhas],	all	the	female	bodhisattvas	of	the
[five]	enlightened	families	who	accompany	the	female	[buddhas],	and	the	entire
maṇḍala	will	arise	[before	you],	perfectly	and	simultaneously.	So	recognise
them!	They	are	your	own	meditational	deities!
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	from	the	hearts	of	the	male	and	female	buddhas	of
the	 five	 enlightened	 families,	 the	 light	 rays	 of	 the	 ‘four	 pristine	 cognitions
combined’,	very	fine	and	clear,	like	a	spider’s	web,	will	dawn	before	your	heart,
[like	the]	entwined	light	rays	of	the	sun.
First,	a	sheet	of	radiant	white
48
	
light	rays,	bright	and	awesome,	[indicative
of]	the	pristine	cognition	of	reality’s	expanse,	will	emanate	from	the	heart	of

Vairocana,	and	touch	your	heart.	Above
49
	
this	sheet	of	light,	a	white	seminal
point	resembling	a	mirror	facing	downwards	will	arise,	emanating	light	rays,
extremely	radiant,	bright	and	dazzling,	adorned	with	five	distinct	seminal	points
of	like	nature,	each	of	which	in	turn	will	be	adorned	by	greater	and	lesser
seminal	points,	[forming	an	array]	with	no	centre	or	horizon.
[Second],	a	sheet	of	radiant	blue	light,	[indicative	of]	the	mirror-like	pristine
cognition,	 [will	 emanate]	 from	 the	 heart	 of	 Vajrasattva.	 Above	 this,	 like	 a
turquoise	bowl	facing	downwards,	a	radiant	blue	seminal	point	will	arise,	[also]
adorned	by	[an	array	of]	greater	and	lesser	seminal	points.
[Third],	a	sheet	of	radiant	yellow	light,	[indicative	of]	the	pristine	cognition
of	sameness,	[will	emanate]	from	the	heart	of	Ratnasambhava.	Above	this,	like	a
gold	cup	facing	downwards,	a	radiant	yellow	seminal	point	will	arise,	[also]
adorned	by	[an	array	of]	greater	and	lesser	seminal	points.
[Fourth],	a	sheet	of	radiant	red	light,	[indicative	of]	the	pristine	cognition	of
discernment,	[will	emanate]	from	the	heart	of	Amitābha.	Above	this,	like	a	coral
bowl	 facing	 downwards,	 a	 radiant	 red	 seminal	 point	 will	 arise,	 extremely
luminous	and	dazzling,	
[resplendent]	with	the	luminosity	of	pristine	cognition.	It
too	will	be	adorned	with	five	distinct	seminal	points	of	like	nature,	each	of	which
in	turn	will	also	be	adorned	by	greater	and	lesser	seminal	points,	[forming	an
array]	with	no	centre	or	horizon.	All	of	these	[lights	and	seminal	points]	will
indeed	arise,	and	touch	your	heart.
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	these	[radiances]	are	arising	out	of	the	natural
expressive	power	of	your	own	awareness.	They	have	not	come	from	anywhere
else.	Therefore,	do	not	be	attached	to	them!	Do	not	be	a	fraid	of	them!	Relax	and
rest	in	a	non-conceptual	state.
50
	
[Abiding]	in	this	state,	all	the	buddha-bodies
and	light	rays	will	merge	into	you,	and	buddhahood	will	then	be	attained.
O,	 Child	 of	 Buddha	 Nature,	 [during	 the	 above	 series]	 the	 green	 light
[indicative]	of	the	pristine	cognition	of	accomplishment	will	not	arise.	The
reason	for	this	is	that	the	natural	expressive	power	of	pristine	cognition,	which	is
your	own	intrinsic	awareness,	is	not	yet	perfected.
51
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	this	[array	of	luminosities	that	you	are	now
experiencing]	is	called:	‘the	vision	of	the	four	pristine	cognitions	combined’.	It
is	[also]	known	as	the	‘hollow	passageway	of	Vajrasattva’.
52
	
At	 this	 time,
therefore,	you	should	recall	the	oral	instructions,	which	your	spiritual	teacher
formerly	 introduced	 to	 you.	 If	 you	 [successfully]	 recall	 this	 [former]
introduction,	you	will	have	confidence	in	the	visions	that	have	already	arisen,

and	you	will	recognise	them,	just	as	there	is	instant	recognition	at	the	meeting	of
a	mother	and	her	son,	or	just	as	one	instantly	recognises	an	old	acquaintance
the	moment	one	sees	them.	Cutting	through	any	doubt,	you	will	recognise	[these
radiances]	 to	 be	 natural	 manifestations	 [of	 actual	 reality].	 Achieving
confidence,	in	this	way,	in	the	unchanging	path	of	pure	reality,	and	sustaining	a
continuous	meditative	stability,

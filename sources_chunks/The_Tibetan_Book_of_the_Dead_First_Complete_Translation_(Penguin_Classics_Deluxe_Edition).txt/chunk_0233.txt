Discriminative	Awareness
	
shes-rab
,	Skt.	
prajñā
The	Sanskrit	term	
prajñā
	is	formally	defined	as	‘the	discriminative	awareness	of
the	essence,	distinctions,	particular	and	general	characteristics,	and	advantages
and	 disadvantages	 of	 any	 object	 within	 one’s	 own	 perceptual	 range,	 at	 the
conclusion	of	which	doubts	are	removed’.	In	other	words,	this	is	the	faculty	of
intelligence	or	discriminating	awareness	inherent	within	the	mental	continuum
of	all	living	creatures	which	enables	them	to	examine	the	characteristics	of
things	and	events,	thus	making	it	possible	to	make	judgements	and	deliberations.
The	term	
prajñā
	has	commonly	been	translated	into	English	as	‘wisdom’,	largely
following	the	example	of	Edward	Conze,	who	translated	a	voluminous	series	of
texts	devoted	to	the	
Perfection	of	Discriminative	Awareness
	(
Prajñāpāramitā
).
According	to	the	
abhidharma
	
of	the	
Lesser	Vehicule
,	
prajñā
	is	one	of	the	five
mental	 factors	 of	 ascertainment	 which	 arise	 during	 all	 mental	 events	 of	 a
veridical	nature.	According	to	the	
Greater	Vehicule
,	 the	 perfection	 of	 this

faculty	of	discriminative	awareness	(
prajñāpāramitā
	
)	leads	a	
bodhisattva
	to	a
total	overcoming	of	all	types	of	doubt	and	ignorance	and	to	the	realisation	of	the
emptiness
	of	all	things.	Here,	in	conjunction	with	
skilful	means
	(
upāya
),	the
term	
prajñopāya
	refers	to	the	integration	of	the	two	principal	aspects	of	the	path
to	
enlightenment
.	In	this	context	
prajñā
,	or	true	insight	into	the	
emptiness
	of	all
phenomena,	is	united	in	perfect	union	with	
skilful	means
.	In	tantric	traditions,
the	union	of	
prajñopāya
	is	often	depicted	iconographically	in	the	union	of	the
male	and	female	deities,	and	in	the	symbolic	hand-implements	such	as	the	
vajra
and	the	bell.
	
Dissonant	Mental	States
	
nyonmongs
,	Skt.	
kleśa
The	essentially	pure	nature	of	
mind
	is	obscured	and	afflicted	by	the	various
psychological	defilements	known	as	the	dissonant	mental	states.	The	Tibetan
word	
nyonmongs
	
implies	a	mental	event	whose	arising	causes	psychological
afflictions	within	the	
mind
,	thus	destroying	its	peace	and	composure.	According
to	
abhidharma
	
literature	in	general,	there	are	six	primary	dissonant	mental
states:	
fundamental	 ignorance
,	
attachment
,	
aversion
,	 pride,	 doubt,	 and
afflicted	or	dissonant	views;	and	an	enumeration	of	twenty	subsidiary	mental
states	(Skt.	
upakleśa
),	which	comprise:	anger,	malice,	dissimulation,	fury,	envy,
miserliness,	dishonesty,	deception,	arrogance,	mischief,	indecorum,	indecency,
obfuscation,	agitation,	distrust,	laziness,	
carelessness,	forgetfulness,	distraction,
and	inattentiveness.	Even	more	wide-ranging	are	the	84,000	dissonant	mental
states	for	which	the	84,000	aspects	of	the	
sacred	teachings
	are	said	to	provide
distinctive	antidotes.	At	the	root	of	all	these	psychological	afflictions	lies	the
fundamental	ignorance
	which	misapprehends	the	true	nature	of	
reality

techniques	 for	 retaining	 awareness	 during	 the	 dream	 state;	 multiplying	 and
transforming	the	contents	of	dreams	and	recognising	their	actual	nature;	and	the
dispelling	of	obstacles	which	prevent	maintaining	awareness	in	the	dream	state.
	
Dualism
	
gnyis-snang
,	Skt.	
ubhayābhāsa

Any	level	of	perception	of	duality.	Buddhist	thought	describes	various	forms	of
dualism,	principal	amongst	these	being:	1)	a	dualistic	perception	of	subject	and
object;	 2)	 all	 appearances	 of	
inherent	 existence
;	 3)	 all	 appearances	 of
conventionalities	;	and	4)	all	forms	of	conceptuality.	A	genuine	direct	
realisation
of	
emptiness
	
is	non-dual,	in	that	it	is	free	from	all	the	above	forms	of	dual

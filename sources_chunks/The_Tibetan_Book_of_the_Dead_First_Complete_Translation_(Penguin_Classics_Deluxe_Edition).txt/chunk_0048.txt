To	you,	the	twelve	central,	male	and	female,	blood-drinking	deities,
I	bow	down,	make	offerings,	take	refuge,	and	pray:
As	soon	as	we	die	and	begin	to	transmigrate,
At	that	very	moment,	when	the	visions	of	the	intermediate	state	of	reality
dawn,
And	we	roam	[alone]	in	cyclic	existence	[driven]	by	deep-seated	confused
perceptions,
May	 the	 conquerors,	 the	 male	 wrathful	 blood-drinking	 deities,	 draw	 us
forward,

Leading	us	on	the	path	of	radiant	light,
Which	is	the	five	fully	perfect	pristine	cognitions.
May	the	assembly	of	wrathful	female	deities,	Queens	of	the	Expanse,	support
us	from	behind,
And	thus	[encircled]	may	we	be	rescued
From	the	fearsome	passageway	of	the	intermediate	state,
And	be	escorted	to	the	level	of	an	utterly	perfected	buddha.

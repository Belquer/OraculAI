),	 grouped	 as	 follows:	 those	 of	 the	 eye,	 form	 and	 visual
consciousness
;	those	of	the	ear,	sound,	and	auditory

Sentient	Being
	
sems-can/’gro-ba
,	Skt.	
sattva
/	
gati
In	a	Buddhist	context,	the	expression	‘sentient	being’	has	a	technical	usage
which	contrasts	with	the	concept	of	a	
buddha
.	The	term	refers	to	beings	in
cyclic	existence
	
and	also	those	who	have	attained	
liberation
	from	it	but	who
have	not	attained	the	non-abiding	
nirvāṇa
	of	fully	manifest	
buddhahood
.	The
Sanskrit	term	
gati
	(Tib.	
’gro-ba
)	literally	means	‘goer’,	and	
sattva
,	a	‘living
being’.	The	Tibetan	equivalent	of	the	latter,	
sems-can
,	literally	means	‘sentient’
or	 ‘a	 being	 with	
mind
’,	 as	 it	 does	 in	 English.	 See	
Sex	 Classes	 of
Sentient/Living	Beings

Serpentine	Water	Spirits
	
klu/klu-mo
,	Skt.	
nāga
/
nāgin
ῑ
Male	or	female	water	spirits,	often	depicted	as	half	human	and	half	serpentine,
who	 reside	 in	 oceans,	 rivers,	 lakes	 and	 springs,	 and	 who	 are	 described	 in
Buddhist	 literature	 as	 custodians	 or	 repositories	 of	 submerged	 spiritual	 or
material	
treasure
.	It	is	considered	important	that	their	environment	should	be
kept	 pristine	 and	 clean;	 otherwise,	 agitation	 or	 pollution	 can	 result	 in	 the
emergence	of	water	spirits	that	engender	leprosy,	consumption	and	various	skin
ailments.

monastic	community
of	monks	and	nuns	(Skt.	
saṅgha
,	Tib.	
dge-’dun
).	Together	these	three	form	the
outer	objects	of	
refuge
	(see	Chapter	1).	They	are	regarded	as	the	perfect	objects
in	which	
refuge
	can	be	sought	from	the	unsatisfactory	nature	of	life	in	
cyclic
existence
	 in	 general,	 and	 particularly	 from	 the	 potential	
suffering
	 of
unfavourable	future	existences.	They	are	called	‘precious	jewels’	because,	like
the	wish-fulfilling	jewels	of	Indian	classical	literature,	in	their	metaphorical
sense,	they	possess	the	wish-fulfilling	capacity	to	provide	protection	from	the
perils	of	
cyclic	existence

Three	Roots

The	three	roots	jointly	form	the	inner	object	of	
refuge
,	according	to	the	
tantras
(see	Chapter	1).	They	comprise	the	
spiritual	teacher
	(Skt.	
guru
,	Tib.	
bla-ma
),
who	confers	
blessing
	(Skt.	
adhiṣṭhāna
),	the	
meditational	deity
	(Skt.	
iṣṭadevatā
,
Tib.	
yi-dam	lha
)	who	confers	
accomplishments
	(Skt.	
siddhi
);	and	the	
ḍākin
ῑ
(Tib.	
mkha’-’gro
)	 who	 confer	 the	 actualisation	 of	
buddha	 activities
	 (Skt.
kṛtyakriyā
).	See	their	individual	entries	and	also	under

Three	World-systems
	
’jig-rten-gyi	khams	gsum
,	Skt.	
tridhātu
According	to	Buddhism,	
cyclic	existence
	includes	three	world-systems,	namely:
the	world-system	of	desire	(Skt
.	kāmadhātu
),	the	world-system	of	form	(Skt.
rūpadhātu
	
),	and	the	world-system	of	formlessness	(Skt.	
ārūpyadhātu
).	Among

them,	the	world-system	of	desire	is	a	state	of	existence	dominated	by	sensual
experiences,	particularly	the	sensations	of	suffering	and	pleasure.	It	is	inhabited
by	all	
six	classes	of	sentient	beings
,	including	humans	and	six	categories	of
gods
	(
kāmadevaṣaṭkula
).	The	world-system	of	form,	in	which	beings	have	a
comparatively	 subtle	 level	 of	 consciousness,	 temporarily	 devoid	 of	 gross
sensations	of	pain	and	pleasure,	is	regarded	as	a	state	beyond	ordinary	human
existence	 and	 inhabited	 only	 by	 gods.	 Birth	 in	 such	 a	 realm	 requires	 the
attainment	 of	 one	 or	 all	 of	 the	 four	
meditative	 concentrations
	 (Skt.
caturdhyāna
),	in	past	lives.	
Abhidharma
	literature	mentions	twelve	ordinary
realms	of	form	and	five	‘pure	abodes’	(
pañcaśuddhanivāsa
),	above	them,	where
birth	can	be	taken	consequent	on	these	four	concentrations.	Lastly,	the	world-
system	of	formlessness	is	regarded	as	the	highest	level	of	rebirth	within	
cyclic
existence
	and	a	state	where	an	individual’s	physical	faculties	exist	only	as
potencies	and	the	individual	functions	only	at	the	level	of	consciousness.	It	is
said	to	be	inhabited	by	those	who	have	mastered	the	
four	formless	meditative
absorptions
	
(Skt
.	catursamāpatti
).
	
Torma-offering
	
gtor-ma
,	Skt.	
naivedya/bali
Torma
-offerings	are	cakes,	usually	made	of	dough	and	often	decorated	with
colourful	 butter	 sculptures.	 Sometimes	 they	 are	 embodiments	 of	 the
meditational	deities
	
associated	with	particular	ritual	practices,	or	they	may	be
food-offerings	 presented	 to	 various	 deities	 or	
protectors
	 visualised	 in	 the
context	of	meditation.	Yet	again,	
tormas
	may	act	as	physical	symbols	into	which
diverse	aspects	of	negativity	are	absorbed,	transformed,	and	removed	through
ritual	practices.
	
Transcendent	Lord
	
bcom-ldan-’das
,	Skt.	
bhagavān
According	to	the	Tibetan	interpretation,	the	Sanskrit	honorific	term	‘
bhagavān
’,
which	has	often	been	translated	as	‘Blessed	Lord’,	indicates	a	
buddha
	who	has:
1)	 ‘destroyed’	 (
bcom
)	 the	 four	
malevolent/beguiling	 forces
	 (
caturmāra
)
comprising	 the	 influence	 of	 the	 psycho-physical	
aggregates
	 (
skandha
),
dissonant	mental	states
	
(
kleśa
),	sensual	temptations	and	mundane	death;	2)
come	to	‘possess’	(
ldan
)	the	six	excellences	(
ṣaḍguṇa
)	of	lordship,	form,	glory,
fam

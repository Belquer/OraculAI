Anguished	Spirits

preta
Among	the	
six	classes	of	living	beings
,	the	anguished	spirits	are	characterised	as
being	in	a	state	of	existence	which,	in	terms	of	the	degree	of	suffering,	is
intermediate	to	the	animal	and	
hell
	realms.	Born	as	a	result	of	a	preponderance
of	miserliness	in	their	past	actions,	they	are	characterised	by	unsatisfied	craving.

	
Antigod
	
lha-ma-yin
,	Skt.	
asura
One	of	
six	classes	of	living	beings
	(
’gro-ba	rigs-drug
).	The	mode	of	being	and
activity	of	the	antigods	is	said	to	be	engendered	and	dominated	by	envy,	self-
centred	 ambition	 and	 hostility.	 They	 are	 metaphorically	 described	 as	 being
incessantly	 embroiled	 in	 a	 dispute	 with	 the	
gods
	 (Skt.	
deva
/
sura
)	 over	 the
possession	of	a	magical	tree.

rjes	su	rnal-’byor

according	to	the

Apparent	Reality
	
chos-can
,	Skt.	
dharmin
According	to	the	
Greater	Vehicle
,	the	apparent	reality	of	phenomena	refers	to
the	world	of	conventional	truth	characterised	by	duality,	cause	and	effect	and
multiplicity.	This	is	contrasted	with	the	
actual	reality
,	which	is	the	ultimate
nature	of	phenomena.	See	
Two	Truths
.
	
Arhat
	
dgra-bcom-pa
A	being	who	has	attained	freedom	from	the	
cycle	of	existence
	(
samsāra
)	by
eliminating	the	
karmic
	tendencies	and	the	
dissonant	mental	states
	which	give
rise	to	compulsive	existence	in	a	cycle	of	death	and	rebirth.	
Arhat
,	literally
‘worthy’,	is	interpreted	to	mean	‘Foe	Destroyer’,	the	foe	in	this	context	being	the
dissonant	mental	states
	
which	are	at	the	root	of	our	conditioned	existence.	The
status	of	an	
arhat
	is	the	ideal	goal	to	which	practitioners	of	the	
Lesser	Vehicle
aspire.	An	individual	person	who	becomes	an	
arhat
	has	still	not	become	a	fully
enlightened	buddha
.	This	is	because	the	attainment	of	
buddhahood
	requires,	in
addition	to	the	elimination	of	the	
dissonant	mental	states
,	a	total	overcoming	of
all	the	habitual	tendencies	imprinted	upon	our	mental	continuum	by	our	long
association	with	deluded	states	of	
mind
.	In	other	words,	the	attainment	of	full
enlightenment
	requires	the	total	overcoming	of	all	personal	limitations,	which
can	be	achieved	only	through	a	path	that	possesses	the	unification	of	the	
skilful
means
	of	universal	
compassion
	together	with	the	
discriminative	awareness
directly	perceiving	the	actual	nature	of	
reality
,	at	the	most	profound	level.
	

Ascending	and	Core-penetrating
	
yar-gyi	zang-thal
According	 to	
Atiyoga
,	 the	 attainment	 of	 the	
Buddha-body	 of	 Reality
(
dharmakāya
)	is	described	as	‘ascending	and	core-penetrating’	(
yar-gyi	zang-
thal
).	 Here,	 ‘ascending’	 (
yar-gyi
)	 refers	 to	 the	 upward	 movement	 of
consciousness
	through	the	
mentral	channel
	of	the	body	and	the	consequent
‘
core-penetrating
’	 to	 the	 transformation	 of	 consciousness	 into	 the	
pristine
cognition
	of	
reality’s	expanse
	(
dharmadhātujñāna
).

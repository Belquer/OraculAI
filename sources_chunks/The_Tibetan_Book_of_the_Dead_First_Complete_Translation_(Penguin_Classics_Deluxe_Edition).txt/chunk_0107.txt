[The	main	subject	matter	of	the

sections:	the	introduction	to	inner	radiance	during	the	intermediate	state	of	the
time	of	death,
13
	the	great	elucidation	which	introduces	the	intermediate	state	of
reality

	and	a	teaching	on	the	means	for	obstructing	the	entrance	to	the	womb
during	the	intermediate	state	of	rebirth.

Introduction	to	Inner	Radiance	in	the	Intermediate	State	of	the	Time	of	Death
	
This	 introduction	 is	 made	 on	 behalf	 of	 those	 individuals	 who	 have	 good
understanding,	but	do	not	yet	have	recognition	[of	inner	radiance],	as	well	as
those	who	have	gained	recognition	but	have	little	familiarity,	and	all	ordinary
persons	 who	 have	 received	 little	 experiential	 guidance.	 By	 means	 of	 [this
introduction],	 such	 beings	 will,	 upon	 recognising	 the	 inner	 radiance	 of	 the
ground,	attain	the	uncreated	Buddha-body	of	Reality,	in	an	ascending	and	core-
penetrating	manner,	without	[experiencing]	the	intermediate	states.
	
Introduction	to	the	Inner	Radiance	of	the	Ground
	
As	for	the	method	of	making	[this	introduction],	it	is	best	if	the	root	spiritual
teacher	from	whom	[the	dying	person]	personally	received	guidance	can	be
present.	 If	 he	 cannot	 be	 present,	 then	 a	 spiritual	 sibling	 with	 identical
commitments
16
	[should	be	called	upon],	or	if	none	of	these	can	be	present,	then
a	spiritual	friend	holding	the	same	lineage
17
	should	attend;	or	if	none	of	these	at
all	 can	 be	 present,	 someone	 who	 knows	 how	 to	 read	 aloud	 with	 correct
pronunciation	and	clear	diction	should	recite	[the	introductions]	many	times.
Thereby,	[the	dying	person]	will	remember	
that	which	had	[formerly]	been
introduced	by	his	or	her	spiritual	teacher	and	immediately	afterwards,	being	set
face	to	face	with	the	inner	radiance	of	the	ground,	will	undoubtedly	attain
liberation.
Concerning	 the	 time	 for	 making	 [this	 introduction]:	 after	 respiration	 has

ceased,	the	vital	energy	is	absorbed	into	the	channel	of	pristine	cognition
18
	and
the	consciousness	[of	the	deceased]	naturally	arises	as	a	non-conceptual	inner
radiance.	Later,	the	vital	energy	will	be	reversed	and	escape	into	the	right	and
left	channels	and,	as	a	result,	the	appearances	of	the	[subsequent]	intermediate
state	 [of	 reality]	 will	 arise	 suddenly.	 Therefore,	 [the	 introduction	 to	 inner
radiance	at	the	time	of	death]	should	be	made	before	[the	vital	energy]	has
escaped	into	the	right	and	left	channels.	[Generally],	the	length	of	time	during
which	the	inner	breath	remains	present	within	the	central	channel	is	just	about
the	time	taken	to	eat	a	meal.
19
As	regards	the	actual	mode	of	making	[this	introduction],	it	is	best	if	the
consciousness	transference	is	effected	at	that	moment	when	the	respiration	is
about	to	cease.	If	it	is	not,	one	should	say	the	following	words:
	
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,
	(call	the	name	of	the	dying	person)
,	the	time	has
now	come	for	you	to	seek	a	path.	As	soon	as	your	respiration	ceases,	[the
luminosity]	known	as	the	‘inner	radiance	of	the	first	intermediate	state’,
20
which	 your	 spiritual	 teacher	 formerly	 introduced	 to	 you,	 will	 arise.
[Immediately]	your	respiration	ceases,	all	phenomena	will	become	empty
	
and
utterly	naked	like	space.	[At	the	same	time],	a	naked	awareness	will	arise,	not
extraneous	[to	yourself],	but	radiant,	empty	and	without	horizon	or	centre.	At
that	moment,	you	should	personally	recognise	this	intrinsic	nature	and	rest	in	the
state	of	that	[experience].	I	too	will	introduce	it	[to	you]	at	that	time.
21
	
These	words	should	be	spoken	audibly	many	times,	impressing	them	on	the
mind	[of	the	dying	person]	until	respiration	ceases.
Then,	when	the	respiration	is	on	the	point	of	ceasing,	one	should	lay	[the
dying	person]	on	the	right	side,	in	the	posture	of	the	lion,	and	take	the	pulse.

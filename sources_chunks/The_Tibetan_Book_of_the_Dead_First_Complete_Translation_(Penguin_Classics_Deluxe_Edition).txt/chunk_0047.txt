In	the	northern	channel	branch	of	the	energy	centre	of	perfect	resource,	within
one’s	throat,
Is	the	great	Awareness	Holder	of	Spontaneous	Presence,
Green,	radiant,	wrathful,	smiling,	and	embraced	by	the	Green	Ḍākin
ῑ.
[She	holds]	a	blood-filled	skull	and	a	curved	knife,
Raised	in	the	gesture	of	pointing	to	the	sky.
May	the	awareness	holders	of	buddha-activity	protect	all	living	beings!
	
OṂ	ĀḤ	HŪṂ
To	you,	the	assembly	of	awareness	holders,	the	heroes	and	ḍākin
ῑ
s,
I	bow	down,	make	offerings,	take	refuge	and	pray:
As	soon	as	we	die	and	begin	to	transmigrate,
At	that	very	moment,	when	the	visions	of	the	intermediate	state	of	reality
dawn,
And	we	roam	[alone]	in	cyclic	existence	[driven]	by	deep-seated	habitual
tendencies,
May	the	heroic	awareness	holders	draw	us	forward,
Leading	us	on	the	path	of	radiant	light,
Which	is	the	[luminance	of]	spontaneously	arising	pristine	cognition.
16
May	the	supreme	female	consorts,	the	assembly	of	ḍākin
ῑ
s,	support	us	from
behind,
And	thus	[encircled]	may	we	be	rescued
From	the	fearsome	passageway	of	the	intermediate	state,
And	be	escorted	to	the	pure	fields	of	the	sky-farers.
	
OṂ	ĀḤ	HŪṂ
At	this	time	when	we	dwell	within	the	intermediate	state	of	living,
The	assemblies	of	awareness	holders,	both	heroes	and	ḍākin
ῑ
s,
Are	radiantly	present	within	the	celestial	palace	of	the	energy	centre	of	perfect
resource	within	our	own	throats,
Embodied	in	the	form	of	a	cluster	of	five-coloured	lights.
Yet,	as	soon	as	we	die	and	begin	to	transmigrate,

This	divine	assembly	of	the	awareness	holders	will	emerge	from	the	throat
[centre],
And	fill	the	space	before	us.
Amidst	a	plethora	of	musical	sounds	they	will	manifest	in	myriad	dancing
postures,
Pounding	and	vibrating	throughout	all	world-systems,
[And	generating]	a	vibrant	beaming	path	of	light,
Indicative	of	spontaneously	arising	pristine	cognition.
Simultaneously,	the	[light]	path	of	the	animal	realms,	indicative	of	delusion,
Will	[also]	dawn	before	us.
O	divine	assembly	of	awareness	holders,	at	that	moment,
Do	not	withhold	your	compassion,
But	draw	us	back	from	the	[dull-light]	path,
Which	is	the	gateway	to	the	deluded	animal-realms,
And	draw	all	beings	along	the	path	[of	light],
Which	is	[the	luminance	of]	spontaneously	arising	pristine	cognition!
Seize	us	with	your	compassion,
[Ensuring]	that	we	recognise	[the	characteristics	of]	the	intermediate	state!
Empower	us	so	that	we	may	become	awareness	holders,	children	of	the
Conquerors.

At	the	crown-centre	of	onself,	[visualised]	as	Vajrasattva,
In	the	celestial	palace	of	the	blazing	skull,	within	one’s	brain,
Amidst	an	expanse	of	light	composed	of	flaming	seminal	points	of	rainbow-

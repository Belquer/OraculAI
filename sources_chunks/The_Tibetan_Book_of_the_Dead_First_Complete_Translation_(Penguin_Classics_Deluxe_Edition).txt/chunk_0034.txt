ll	respects,
Not	a	mere	nothingness,	for	it	is	radiant	and	clear,
Not	a	single	entity,	for	it	is	clearly	perceptible	as	a	multiplicity,
Yet	not	existing	inherently	as	a	multiplicity,	for	it	is	indivisible	and	of	a	single
savour.

This	intrinsic	awareness,	which	is	not	extraneously	derived,
Is	itself	the	genuine	introduction	to	the	abiding	nature	of	[all]	things.
For	in	this	[intrinsic	awareness],	the	three	buddha-bodies	are	inseparable,	and
fully	present	as	one:
Its	emptiness	and	utter	lack	of	inherent	existence	is	the	Buddha-body	of
Reality;
The	natural	resonance	and	radiance	of	this	emptiness	is	the	Buddha-body	of
Perfect	Resource;
And	its	unimpeded	arising	in	any	form	whatsoever	is	the	Buddha-body	of
Emanation.
These	three,	fully	present	as	one,	are	the	very	essence	[of	awareness]	itself.
[CONSEQUENCES	OF	THE	INTRODUCTION	TO
AWARENESS]
When	the	introduction	is	powerfully	applied	in	accordance	with	the	[above]
method	for	entering	into	this	[reality]:
One’s	own	immediate	consciousness	is	this	very	[reality]!
[Abiding]	in	this	[reality],	which	is	uncontrived	and	naturally	radiant,
How	can	one	say	that	one	does	not	understand	the	nature	of	mind?

[Abiding]	in	this	[reality],	wherein	there	is	nothing	on	which	to	meditate,
How	 can	 one	 say	 that,	 by	 having	 entered	 into	 meditation,	 one	 was	 not
successful?
[Abiding]	in	this	[reality],	which	is	one’s	actual	awareness	itself,
How	can	one	say	that	one	could	not	find	one’s	own	mind?
[Abiding]	 in	 this	 [reality],	 the	 uninterrupted	 [union]	 of	 radiance	 and
awareness,
How	can	one	say	that	the	[true]	face	of	mind	has	not	been	seen?
[Abiding]	in	this	[reality],	which	is	itself	the	cogniser,
How	can	one	say	that,	though	sought,	this	[cogniser]	could	not	be	found?
[Abiding]	in	this	[reality],	where	there	is	nothing	at	all	to	be	done,
How	can	one	say	that,	whatever	one	did,	one	did	not	succeed?
Given	that	it	is	sufficient	to	leave	[this	awareness]	as	it	is,	uncontrived,
How	can	one	say	that	one	could	not	continue	to	abide	[in	that	state]?
Given	 that	 it	 is	 sufficient	 to	 leave	 it	 as	 it	 is,	 without	 doing	 anything
whatsoever,
How	can	one	say	that	one	could	not	do	just	that?
Given	 that,	 [within	 this	 reality],	 radiance,	 awareness,	 and	 emptiness	 are
inseparable	and	spontaneously	present,
How	can	one	say	that,	by	having	practised,	one	attained	nothing?
Given	that	[this	reality]	is	naturally	originating	and	spontaneously	present,
without	causes	or	conditions,
How	 can	 one	 say	 that,	 by	 having	 made	 the	 effort	 [to	 find	 it],	 one	 was
incapable	[of	success]?
Given	 that	 the	 arising	 and	 liberation	 of	 conceptual	 thoughts	 occur
simultaneously,
How	 can	 one	 say	 that,	 by	 having	 applied	 this	 antidote	 [to	 conceptual
thoughts],	one	was	not	effective?
[Abiding]	in	this	immediate	consciousness	itself,
How	can	one	say	that	one	does	not	know	this	[reality]?

[OBSERVATIONS	RELATED	TO	EXAMINING	THE	NATURE
OF	MIND]
Be	certain	that	the	nature	of	mind	is	empty	and	without	foundation.

One’s	own	mind	is	insubstantial,	like	an	empty	sky.
Look	at	your	own	mind	to	see	whether	it	is	like	that	or	not.
Divorced	 from	 views	 which	 constructedly	 determine	 [the	 nature	 of]
emptiness,
Be	certain	that	pristine	cognition,	naturally	originating,	is	primordially	radiant
—
Just	like	the	nucleus	of	the	sun,	which	is	itself	naturally	originating.
Look	at	your	own	mind	to	see	whether	it	is	like	that	or	not!
	
Be	certain	that	this	awareness,	which	is	pristine	cognition,	is	uninterrupted,
Like	the	coursing	central	torrent	of	a	river	which	flows	unceasingly.
Look	at	your	own	mind	to	see	whether	it	is	like	that	or	not!
	
Be	certain	that	conceptual	thoughts	and	fleeting	memories	are	not	strictly
identifiable,
But	insubstantial	in	their	motion,	like	the	breezes	of	the	atmosphere.
Look	at	your	own	mind	to	see	whether	it	is	like	that	or	not!
	
Be	certain	that	all	that	appears	is	naturally	manifest	[in	the	mind],
Like	the	images	in	a	mirror	which	[also]	appear	naturally.

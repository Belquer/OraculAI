the	[four]	continents,	will	arise.	You	must	recognise	these
[indications]!	 Indeed,	 you	 must	 choose	 the	 continent	 based	 on	 [a	 careful
examination	of	these]	indications	of	the	environment	into	which	you	may	be
born.

If	you	are	to	take	birth	on	the	Eastern	Continent,	Videha,	you	will	see	a	lake,
adorned	by	male	and	female	swans.	Do	not	be	drawn	towards	this	[place]!	Call
to	mind	the	methods	of	reversal	[and	apply	these]!	For	were	you	to	go	there,
even	though	it	is	a	happy	and	tranquil	place,	it	is	an	environment	where	the
[sacred]	teachings	do	not	flourish.	So	do	not	enter	[this	continent]!
If	you	are	to	take	birth	on	the	Southern	Continent,	Jambudv
ῑ
pa,	you	will	see
grand	and	delightful	mansions.	If	indeed	you	can	enter	here,	do	so!
If	you	are	to	take	birth	on	the	Western	Continent,	Aparagodan
ῑ
ya,	you	will	see
a	lake	adorned	[around	its	shores]	by	male	and	female	horses.	Do	not	be	drawn
towards	this	place!	Call	to	mind	the	methods	of	reversal	[and	apply	these]!	For
even	though	it	is	a	place	of	great	wealth	and	[abundant]	resources,	it	is	an
environment	where	the	[sacred]	teachings	do	not	flourish.	So	do	not	enter	[this
continent]!
If	you	are	to	take	birth	on	the	Northern	Continent,	Uttarakuru,	you	will	see	a
lake	adorned	[around	its	shores]	by	cattle	or	a	lake	adorned	by	trees.	Recognise
these	appearances	as	indications	of	the	birth	that	you	are	about	to	assume!	Do
not	enter	there!	For	even	though	this	is	a	place	where	there	is	longevity	and
which	has	merit,	it	is	an	environment	where	the	[sacred]	teachings	do	not
flourish.	So	do	not	enter	[this	continent]!
If	you	are	to	take	birth	as	a	god	you	will	see	delightful	celestial	palaces,
many-storeyed	and	composed	of	diverse	jewels.	If	indeed	you	can,	you	should
enter	here!
If	you	are	to	take	birth	as	an	antigod,	you	will	see	exquisite	groves	and
spinning	wooden	torches	[creating]	wheels	of	fire.	Do	not	enter	there,	under	any
circumstances!	Call	to	mind	the	methods	of	reversal	[and	apply	these]!
If	you	are	to	take	birth	as	an	animal,	you	will	see	rocky	caverns,	empty
hollows	and	straw	sheds,	shrouded	by	mist.	Do	not	enter	there!
If	you	are	to	take	birth	as	an	anguished	spirit,	you	will	see	tree-stumps,	black
protruding	silhouettes,	blind	desolate	gorges,	or	total	darkness.	Were	you	to	go
there,	you	would	be	born	as	an	anguished	spirit	and	experience	the	manifold
sufferings	of	[insatiable]	hunger	and	thirst.	Do	not	enter	there!	Call	to	mind	the
methods	of	reversal	[and	apply	these]!	Be	courageous	and	strong!
If	you	are	to	take	birth	as	a	hell	being,	you	will	hear	the	songs	of	those	of
negative	past	actions.	Or,	quite	simply,	you	will	feel	powerless	and	compelled	to
enter.	Whereupon,	the	perception	will	arise	that	you	are	moving	into	a	land	of
darkness,	where	there	are	black	and	reddened	houses,	black	earth-pits	and	black
roads.	Were	you	to	be	drawn	to	this	place,	you	would	enter	the	hells,	and

experience	the	[searing]	unbearable	sufferings	of	heat	and	cold.	Be	careful!	Do
not	enter	into	the	midst	of	this,	for	there	will	be	no	opportunity	to	turn	back.	Do
not	enter	there,	under	any	circumstances!	As	it	is	said	[in	the	root	verses]:	‘You
must	obstruct	the	womb	entrances	and	call	to	mind	the	methods	of	reversal.’
These	are	[wholly]	necessary	now!
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	although	you	do	not	wish	to	move	forward,	you
are	powerless	not	to	do	so.	The	avenging	forces,	who	are	the	executors	of	the
unfailing	laws	of	cause	and	effect,	will	be	
pursuing	you.	You	will	have	no	choice
but	to	move	forward.	Before	you,	the	avengers	and	executors	will	be	leading	the
way.	The	experience	will	arise	of	trying	to	flee	from	these	forces,	of	trying	to	flee
from	the	darkness,	from	the	most	violent	windstorms,	from	the	[thunderous]
tumult,	the	snow,	the	rain,	the	hail	and	the	turbulent	blizzards,	which	swirl
around	you.	[Frightened],	you	will	set	off	to	seek	a	refuge	and	you	will	find
protection	inside	an	enclosed	space,	such	as	within	the	mansions,	just	described,
or	in	rock-shelters,	or	hol

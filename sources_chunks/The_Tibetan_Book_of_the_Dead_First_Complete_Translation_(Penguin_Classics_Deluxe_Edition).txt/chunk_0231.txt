spiritual	leader	of	Tibet.	The	
Dalai	Lama’s
	temporal	reign
began	at	the	time	of	the	fifth	
Dalai	Lama
	in	the	17th	century.	Since	then	the
country	has	been	ruled,	periodically,	by	a	succession	of	
Dalai	Lamas
,	until
China’s	occupation	in	the	1950s.	The	
Dalai	Lamas
	are	chosen	according	to	a
strict	traditional	procedure	of	observation	and	examination	initiated	following
the	death	of	the	previous	
Dalai	Lama
.	The	present	
Dalai	Lama
	is	the	fourteenth
in	the	succession	of	this	lineage.	The	title	
Dalai	Lama
	was	originally	offered	to
Sonam	Gyatso
,	the	third	
Dalai	Lama
,	by	the	then	Mongol	prince	
Altan	Qan
.	The
Mongol	word	
da-lai
	(Tib.	
rgya-mtsho
)	means	‘ocean	(of	wisdom)’.
	
Ḍāmaru
	
ḍā-ma-ru
A	hand-held	double-sided	drum,	frequently	identified	with	the	
wrathful	deities
and	the	
ḍākin
ῑ
,	and	generally	utilised	as	a	ritual	instrument	in	conjunction	with
the	bell.	The	
ḍāmaru
	is	said	to	proclaim	‘the	sound	of	great	bliss’.
	
Dedication	of	Merit
	
bsngo-ba
,	Skt.	
pariṇāma
An	important	element	of	Buddhist	practice	enacted	normally	in	the	form	of	a
recitation	of	verses	of	dedication	at	the	conclusion	of	a	spiritual	practice.	In	all
Buddhist	practices,	the	establishment	of	the	correct	motivation	at	the	beginning
and	the	altruistic	dedication	at	the	end	are	regarded	as	highly	significant.	The
most	 popular	 objects	 of	 the	 dedication	 are	 the	 flourishing	 of	 the	
sacred
teachings
	 of	 Buddhism	 throughout	 the	 universe	 and	 the	 attainment	 of	 full
enlightenment
	by	all	
sentient	beings
.
	

Definitive	Meaning
	
nges-don
,	Skt
.	n
ῑ
tārtha
The	
sūtra
	teachings	of	the	
buddhas
	are	classified	as	being	of	either	definitive
meaning	or	provisional	meaning	(
neyārtha
)	depending	on	whether	they	do	not	or
do	 require	 further	 interpretation.	 In	 general,	
sūtras
	 of	 provisional	 meaning
concern	the	nature	of	
cyclic	existence
	(
samsāra
)	and	its	antidotes,	as	expounded
by	
Śākyamuni	 Buddha
	
in	 the	 first	
turning	 of	 the	 wheel	 of	 the	 sacred
teachings
.	By	contrast,	those	
sūtras
	of	definitive	meaning	concern	either	the
nature	of	
emptiness
,	as	expressed	in	the	second	
turning	of	the	wheel	of	the
sacred	 teachings
,	 or	 the	 explications	 on	
buddha	 nature
	
and	
buddha-
attributes
,	 as	 expressed	 in	 the	 third	
turning	 of	 the	 wheel	 of	 the	 sacred
teachings
.	 There	 are	 divergent	 views	 in	 the	 various	 schools	 of	 Tibetan
Buddhism	as	to	which	of	the	
sūtras
	of	the	second	and	third	turnings	should	be
regarded	as	definitive	or	provisional.
	
Degenerate	Age
	
snyigs-ma’i	dus
,	Skt.	
kaliyuga
According	to	the	prevailing	view	of	Indian	cosmology,	a	period	of	cosmic	or
cyclical	 time	 (
aeon
,	 Skt.	
kalpa
)	 comprises	 fourteen	 secondary	 cycles	 (Skt.
manvantara
),	each	of	which	lasts	306,720,000	years.	Each	secondary	cycle	is
said	to	contain	seventy-one	‘great	ages’	(Skt.	
mahāyuga
),	and	each	of	these	is
further	 subdivided	 into	 four	 ages	 (Skt.	
caturyuga
)	 which	 are	 of	 decreasing
duration,	and	known	respectively	as	the	Perfect	Age	(
kṛtayuga
),	the	Third	Age
(
tretāyuga
),	the	Second	Age	(
dvāparayuga
	
),	and	the	Black	or	Degenerate	Age
(
kaliyuga
).	Since	these	four	ages	represent	a	gradual	decline	in	meritorious
activities,	special	meditative	practices	and	spiritual	antidotes	are	associated	with
each	in	turn.	Specifically,	the	Perfect	Age	is	most	suited	
to	the	practice	of	the
Kriyātantra
;	the	Third	Age	to	that	of	the	
Caryātantra
;	the	Second	Age	to	that	of
the	
Yogatantra
;	 and	 the	 present	 Black	 or	 Degenerate	 Age	 to	 that	 of	 the
Unsurpassed
	
Yogatantra

The	confession	[of	faults	in	achieving]	the	meditative	stability	of	the	causal	basis
[entailing	the	visualisation	of]	the	tiered	celestial	palace	and	the	seats	[of	the
wrathful	deities]	is	as	follows:
	
From	the	expanse	of	space,	which	is	the	unborn	ultimate	truth,
There	appears	the	buddha-body,	the	medium	through	which	the	fruitional
attributes	[of	buddhahood]	emerge.
Yet	we	have	not	even	clearly	visualised	this	powerful	celestial	palace,
The	 abode	 in	 which	 the	 supreme	 power	 [of	 buddha-body]	 is	 gradually
generated.
In	the	presence	of	the	blazing	celestial	palace,	we	seek	forgiveness!

	
Confession	to	the	five	male	herukas,	the	executors	of	buddha-body
	
Though	you	steadfastly	[appear]	as	buddha-bodies,	sealed	within	the	nature	of
supreme	bliss,
Holding	in	your	hands	the	respective	implements,	emblematic	of	the	six
pristine	cognitions,
We	 have	 not	 [even]	 achieved	 the	 experience	 of	 such	 [vividly]	 clear
visualisation.
O	five	blood-drinking	herukas,	we	seek	forgiveness!
	
Confession	to	their	consorts,	the	five	krodheśvar
ῑ
	
O	supreme	mother-consorts,	conjoined	indivisibly	with	the	[male]	buddha-
bodies,
We	have	let	the	light	of	your	non-dual	‘generative	essence’	be	diffused,
Into	the	‘spacious	expanse’,	which	is	the	lotus	seed	of	desire.
O	five	krodheśvar
ῑ
	deities,	we	seek	forgiveness!
	
Confession	to	the	eight	mātaraḥ
	
O	wrathful	female	deities	of	pristine	cognition,	born	of	buddha-mind,
[The	natural	transformation]	of	the	eight	classes	of	consciousness,
O	Gaur
ῑ
	and	accompanying	[Mātaraḥ],	ḍākin
ῑ
s	of	pristine	cognition,
For	whatever	ways	we	have	contradicted	your	buddha-mind,
O	 eight	 mātaraḥ	 [who	 embody]	 the	 classes	 [of	 consciousness],	 we	 seek
forgiveness!
	
Confession	to	the	eight	piśāc
ῑ
	
O	Siṃhamukh
ῑ
	and	accompanying	[piśāc
ῑ
],
Though	you	remain	unwavering	in	a	compassionate	and	quiescent	state,
You	emanate	in	blazing	awesome	forms,	[endowed]	with	fangs	and	wings,
9
To	pacify	misconceptions	and	substantialist	views.
For	whatever	ways	we	have	contradicted	your	buddha-mind,
O	 eight	 piśāc
ῑ
	 [who	 embody]	 the	 objects	 [of	 consciousness],	 we	 seek

forgiveness!
	
Confession	to	the	four	female	gatekeepers
	
O	four	female	gatekeepers,	at	[the	portals	of]	the	ornate	palatial	maṇḍala,
You	who	summon	[with	the	hook],	bind	[with	the	noose],	shackle	[with	the
chain]	and	insulate	[with	the	bell],
O	Horse-headed	Aṅkuśā	and	accompanying	[female	gatekeepers],
For	whatever	ways	we	have	contradicted	your	buddha-mind,
O	seals	of	the	four	gatekeepers,	we	seek	forgiveness!
	
Confession	to	the	twenty-eight	
ῑ
śvar
ῑ
	
O	Iśvar
ῑ
,	you	who	are	accomplished	in	the	rites	of	‘liberation’,
10
And	hold	mastery	over	[the	judgement	of]	virtuous	and	non-virtuous	actions,
O	Iśvar
ῑ
,	assembly	of	mothers,
For	whatever	ways	we	have	contradicted	your	buddha-mind,
O	oceanic	expanse	of	mothers	and	sisters,	we	seek	forgiveness!
	
Confession	to	the	awareness	holders
	
[O	awareness	holders],	though	you	never	stray	from	a	state	of	compassionate
equipoise,
Within	the	maṇḍala	of	spontaneously	present	natural	expression,
We	have	not	achieved	your	[pristine]	clarity	of	subtle	meditative	stability.
O	you	who	maintain	the	enlightened	attributes,	we	seek	your	forgiveness!
	
Confession	of	one’s	beginningless	violation	of	the	commitments
	
Throughout	the	beginningless	succession	of	our	births,
Until	now,	when	we	have	assumed	these,	our	present	bodies,
We	have	revolved	within	the	worlds	of	rebirth,	swayed	by	ignorance,
And	however	many	human	births	we	have	taken,
Wherever	we	have	been	born,	we	have	engaged	in	all	kinds	of	negative	acts,
Including	the	five	inexpiable	crimes	and	the	five	approximate	crimes	—
Actually	committing	them,	or	inciting	[others]	to	commit	them,

And	even	rejoicing	in	committing	and	inciting	them.
Please	direct	your	enlightened	compassion	towards	us!
Grant	us	purification,	and	bestow	your	[spiritual]	accomplishments	upon	us!
	
Then	the	confession	should	be	recited	to	t

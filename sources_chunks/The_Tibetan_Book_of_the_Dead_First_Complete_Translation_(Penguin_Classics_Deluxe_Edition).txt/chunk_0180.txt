And	sounds	will	reverberate	throughout	the	universe.
	
How	wonderful!
The	supreme	innermost	heart-mantra,	unborn	and	liberating,	arises	in	the	form
of	the	following	naturally	present	syllables:
A	Ā	I	Ī̄	U	Ū̄	Ṛ	Ṝ̣LḸ	E	AI	O	AU	AṂ	AḤ.
These	 sixteen	 unborn	 syllables,	 in	 eight	 pairs,	 will	 give	 rise	 to	 an
indestructible	resonance,
While	[externally],	they	will	produce	a	clear	cloudless	sky.
How	wonderful!
The	supreme	innermost	heart-mantra,	unceasing	and	liberating,	arises	in	the
form	of	the	following	naturally	present	syllables:

These	thirty-four	unceasing	syllables,	in	eight	clusters,	will	give	rise	to	an
indestructible	resonance,
Which	is	the	enlightened	intention	of	the	unchanging	[sacred]	teachings,
While	causing	rainbow	lights	and	relics	to	appear	[in	the	pyre].
	
How	wonderful!
The	supreme	innermost	heart-mantra	which	liberates	the	enduring	continuum

These	thirty-nine	liberating	mantra	syllables,	in	twelve	clusters,	give	rise	to	an
indestructible	resonance,
While	[externally]	multiplying	relics	and	[shimmering]	rainbow	lights	will
appear.
	
The	supplementary	mantras	which	symbolise	[the	four]	enlightened	activities
and	[which	are	appended	to	the	basic	mantras	above]	arise	in	the	form	of	the
following	naturally	present	syllables:
	

May	diseases,	possession	by	malignant	forces,
And	the	eight	fears,	together	with	all	negativity	and	obscurations,
Be	pacified	within	the	expanse	of	intrinsic	awareness!
ŚĀNTIṂ	KURUYE	SVĀHĀ
	
May	the	lifespan	[of	beings]	and	all	the	fields	of	merit
Be	enriched	within	the	modality	of	[intrinsic]	awareness!

May	the	Three	Precious	Jewels	and	all	cyclic	existence	and	nirvāṇa
Be	controlled	within	the	modality	of	[intrinsic]	awareness!

May	all	hostile,	obstructing	forces,
The	five	poisons	and	the	three	poisons,
Be	destroyed	within	the	modality	of	[intrinsic]	awareness!
MĀRAYA	PHAṬ	SVĀHĀ
	
May	[all]	these	naturally	present	enlightened	intentions,
Which	are	the	unique	offspring	of	all	the	teachings,
Naturally	arise	and	manifest	for	the	sake	of	sentient	beings!
[CONCLUSION]
Through	[the	power	of]	this	authentic	precious	jewel,
All	one’s	needs	and	wishes	in	this	life	can	be	manifested,
And	in	the	next	life	buddhahood	can	certainly	be	achieved.
	
This	[mantra	circle]	should	be	accurately	inscribed	in	a	headed	script,
On	a	sheet	of	fine	blue	paper,
The	size	of	a	four	finger-width	booklet,
Using	refined	gold,	the	colour	of	the	Buddha,
And	it	should	be	rolled	up	in	silk	in	the	right	way.
28
[Then],	on	the	eighth	day	of	the	lunar	month,
Coinciding	with	the	constellation	Cancer,
A	yogin	with	pure	commitments	should	consecrate	it,

And	then	it	should	be	worn	[continuously].
29
	
Inexpressible	virtues	and	negative	actions	may	both	greatly	increase.
Therefore	the	[yogin]	should	persevere	in	the	practice	of	virtue	and	act	for	the
sake	of	sentient	beings,
Avoiding	even	the	most	minute	of	negative	acts.
One	who	does	this	in	the	correct	manner,
Even	if	he	or	she	has	previously	committed	the	five	inexpiable	crimes,
Cannot	possibly	fall	into	inferior	existences,	once	this	[mantra	circle]	has	been
encountered.
	
Since	even	those	who	have	not	practised	the	[sacred]	teachings	at	all	can
attain	buddhahood	[in	this	way],
It	is	called	the	‘Liberation	by	Wearing’.
Since	all	who	see	this	[mantra]	circle	can	attain	buddhahood,
It	is	called	the	‘Liberation	by	Seeing’.
Since	all	who	touch	it	can	attain	buddhahood,
It	is	called	the	‘Liberation	by	Touching’.
Since	all	who	hear	it	read	aloud	can	attain	buddhahood,
It	is	called	the	‘Liberation	by	Hearing’.
Since	all	who	feel	its	breath	can	attain	buddhahood,
It	is	called	the	‘Liberation	by	Feeling’.

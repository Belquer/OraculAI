es.
Then,	when	the	respiration	is	on	the	point	of	ceasing,	one	should	lay	[the
dying	person]	on	the	right	side,	in	the	posture	of	the	lion,	and	take	the	pulse.
22
Once	the	throbbing	of	the	two	carotid	arteries	has	stopped,	they	should	be	firmly
pressed	[at	their	pressure	points	on	the	neck].
23
	Then	the	vital	energy,	having
entered	the	central	
channel,	cannot	reverse	[and	escape]	and	it	will	certainly
emerge	through	the	crown	fontanelle.
24
	The	introduction	should	continue	to	be
made	at	this	time.
This	phase	in	the	process	of	death	is	called:	‘the	inner	radiance	of	reality
during	 the	 first	 intermediate	 state’.	 It	 is	 the	 unique	 and	 incontrovertible
enlightened	intention	of	the	Buddha-body	of	Reality,	which	arises	in	the	minds

of	all	living	beings.	[At	the	moment	of	death],	this	coincides	with	the	period
when	the	vital	energy	is	absorbed	into	the	central	channel,	after	respiration	has
ceased	and	before	the	ceasing	of	the	inner	breath.	Ordinary	people	describe	this
state	as	‘loss	of	consciousness’.
25
The	duration	of	this	[experience	of	inner	radiance]	is	uncertain,	[for	it	depends
on]	the	health	and	characteristics	of	[the	dying	person’s]	physical	constitution,
and	on	the	degree	of	[his	or	her	proficiency	in	the	practices	related	to]	the	vital
energies	and	channels.	For	those	who	have	considerable	practical	experience,	or
those	who	have	achieved	stability	in	the	practice	of	calm	abiding,	or	those	who
have	healthy	energy	channels,	this	experience	can	be	prolonged.
26
	In	striving	to
make	this	introduction,	therefore,	one	should	remind	[the	deceased]	repeatedly
[by	giving	the	instruction	as	above	and	below],	until	serous	fluid	emerges	from
the	apertures	of	the	sense-organs.
27
	For	those	persons	of	great	negativity	and
those	classes	of	beings	with	unhealthy	channels	this	phase	lasts	no	longer	than	a
single	snapping	of	the	fingers.	In	others,	it	may	last	for	as	long	as	it	takes	to	eat	a
meal.	 However,	 as	 most	 sūtras	 and	 tantras	 state	 that	 the	 period	 of
unconsciousness	[following	the	moment	of	death]	may	last	for	three	and	a	half
days,	generally	one	should	persevere	for	that	length	of	time,	in	making	this
introduction	to	inner	radiance.
As	for	the	way	in	which	this	introduction	is	made:	if	capable,	the	dying	person
should	facilitate	this	of	his	or	her	own	accord	by	projecting	a	formerly	cultivated
[spiritual	practice	into	the	intermediate	state].	If	[the	individual]	is	not	capable	of
this,	then	a	spiritual	teacher,	a	student,	or	a	spiritual	sibling	who	was	a	close
friend,	should	stay	nearby	and	clearly	remind	[the	dying	person]	of	the	signs	[of
death]	in	their	correct	sequence,	saying:
	
Now,	the	sign	of	the	dissolution	of	earth	into	water	is	present,	of	water	into	fire,
fire	into	wind,	wind	into	consciousness,
	
and	so	forth	[as	set	down	in	the	text
entitled	
Natural	Liberation	through	Recognition	of	the	Visual	Indications	and
Signs	of	Death
	].
28
Then,	when	the	sequence	of	the	signs	is	almost	complete,	[the	attendant]
should	encourage	the	dying	person	to	cultivate	the	following	altruistic	intention,
beginning	with	the	words:	‘
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature!
’	or,	if	[the	dying	person]
is	a	spiritual	teacher,	the	attendant	should	gently	say	the	following	words	into	the
ear:
	

O,	Venerable	One!	I	beg	you	not	to	be	distracted	from	the	cultivation	of	an
altruistic	intention!
	
If	[the	dying	person]	is	a	spiritual	sibling	or	anyone	else,	[the	attendant]	should
call	to	him	or	her	by	name	and	say	the	following	words:
	
O,	 Child	 of	 Buddha	 Nature,	 that	 which	 is	 called	 death	 has	 now	 arrived.
Therefore	 you	 should	 adopt	 an	 altruistic	 motivation	 and	 concentrate	 your
thinking	as	follows:	‘I	have	arrived	at	the	time	of	death,	so	now,	relying	on	the
process	of	death,	I	will	single-mindedly	cultivate	an	altruistic	intention.	I	will
meditate	on	the	generation	of	loving	kindness,	compassion	and	an	altruistic
intention	to	attain	enlightenment.	For	the	benefit	of	all	sentient	beings,	who	are
as	limitless	as

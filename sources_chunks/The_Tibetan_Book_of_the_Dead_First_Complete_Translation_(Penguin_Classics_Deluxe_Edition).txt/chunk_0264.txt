Oath-bound	Protectors
	
dam-can
A	class	of	
protectors
	of	the	
sacred	teachings
	who	are	considered	to	have	been
originally	 indigenous	 Tibetan	 spirits,	 bound	 under	 an	 oath	 of	 allegiance	 to
Buddhism	by	
Padmasambhava
	during	the	eighth	century.
	
Obscuration
	
sgrib-pa
,	 Skt.	
āvaraṇa
	
There	 are	 two	 main	 categories	 of
obscurations	(
sgrib-pa
),	namely:	the	
dissonant	mental	states
	(
nyon-sgrib
,	Skt
.
kleśāvaraṇa
)	 which	 are	 the	 obscurations	 to	
liberation
,	 and	 the	 subtle
propensities	of	these	mental	states	as	well	as	that	of	
fundamental	ignorance
,
which	constitute	the	obscurations	to	
omniscience
	(
shes-sgrib
,	Skt.	
jñeyāvaraṇa
).	As	the	terms	themselves	indicate,	the	first	category	of	obscurations	obstruct

the	individual	from	gaining	total	freedom	from	
karmically
	conditioned	
cyclic
existence
	
,	and	the	latter	from	attaining	a	direct	and	non-deceptive	realisation	of
all	 aspects	 of	
reality
.	 The	 obscurations	 to	
liberation
	 include	 not	 only	 the
conscious	states	of	our	
deluded	mind
,	such	as	desire,	hatred,	jealousy,	harmful
intent,	etc.,	but	also	the	psychological	
habitual	tendencies
	which	are	imprinted
by	these	states,	which	serve	as	seeds	for	their	continuity	and	recurrence.	The
second	 category	 of	 obscurations	 refers	 to	 the	 ‘propensities	 for	 bewildering
dualistic	appearance’	(
gnyis-snang	khrul-pa’i	bag-chags
),	the	subtle	dispositions
and	latent	tendencies	which	are	deeply	ingrained	within	an	individual’s	psyche
and	which	are	the	origins	of	our	
dualistic
	perceptions	of	the	phenomenal	world
and	of	our	own	consciousness.	A	total	overcoming	of	both	obscurations	(Tib.
sgrib-gnyis
)	marks	the	attainment	of	
buddhahood
.
	
Obstacle-causing	Spirits
	
bar-cad-kyi	gdon
The	various	classes	of	spirits	(
gdon
)	who	cause	obstacles	to	individuals	and
pollute	the	environment,	which	are	said	to	impede	certain	localities,	the	physical
body	and	human	activities.	In	particular,	there	is	an	enumeration	of	eighteen
such	spirits	to	whom	paediatric	diseases	are	attributed	by	the	Tibetan	medical
tradition.
	
Obstruting	Forces
	
bgegs
,	Skt.	
vighna
A	class	of	forces	which	obstruct	spiritual	practice,	but	whose	obstacles	may	be
considered	psychologically	as	cathartic	in	that	their	emergence	may	suggest	that
one’s	own	negative	
past	actions
	are	ripening	and	therefore	their	negative	impact
is	finally	maturing	and	coming	to	an	end.	Often	when	
means	for	attainment
	are
performed	in	accordance	with	the	
tantras
,	a	
torma
-offering
	is	dedicated	to	such
obstructing	 forces	 prior	 to	 the	 commencement	 of	 the	
generation	 stage
	 of
meditation.
	
Oḍḍiyāna
	
o-rgyan
Oḍḍiyāna
,	 the	 birthplace	 of	
Padmasambhava
,	 is	 the	 name	 of	 an	 ancient
kingdom,	probably	situated	in	the	remote	north-west	of	the	Indian	subcontinent,
where	a	large	corpus	of	tantric	literature	is	said	to	have	been	propagated	in	the
human	world	for	the	first	time.	The	land	of	
Oḍḍiyāna
	is	associated	with	a
number	of	great	
accomplished	masters
	(
siddha
),	including	
Padmasambhava
,
Kambalapāda
,	and	
L
ῑ
lāvajra
	in	particular.	On	the	basis	of	traditional	Tibetan
pilgrimage	accounts,	such	as	that	written	by	
Orgyenpa	Rinchenpel
,	 modern

writers	identify	
Oḍḍiyāna
	
as	having	been	in	the	region	of	the	
Swat
	valley	in
Pakistan.	The	Tibetan	form	of	
Oḍḍiyāna
,	
Orgyen
,	is	also	by	extension	a	name
for	
Padmasambhava
	himself.
	
Offering
	
mchod-pa
,	Skt.	
pūjā
In	a	Buddhist	context,	this	refers	to	offerings	made	to	the	
meditational	deity
,
the	
spiritual	teacher
	or	other	appropriate	objects	of	veneration.	In	general,	there
are	offerings	associated	with	body,	speech	and	mind.	Thus,	an	offering	can	be	of
material	substance	such	as	flowers,	scented	water	and	food,	or	a	verbal	offering,
such	as	the	recitation	of	songs	of	praise,	or	a	mental	offering,	such	as	the
offering	of	the	positive	potentials	which	one	may	have	accumulated	as	a	result	of
having	engaged	in	wholesome	dee

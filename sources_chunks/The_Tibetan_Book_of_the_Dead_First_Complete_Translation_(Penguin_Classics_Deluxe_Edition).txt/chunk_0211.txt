This	is	the	naturally	resonant	mantra	of	the	Buddha	Samantabhadra,	written	in
the	ḍākiṇ
ῑ
	script	of	Oḍḍiyāna,	in	the	form	of	a	vajra-song.	The	ḍākiṇ
ῑ
	script
appears	to	be	only	remotely	related	to	Sanskrit.	The	following	interpretation	of
these	syllables	derives	from	the	
Tantra	of	the	Coalescence	of	Sun	and	Moon
(
Nyi-zla	kha-sbyor-gyi	rgyud
,	sDe-dge	NGB,	Vol.	4,	p.	119a).	For	variant

readings	of	the	mantras,	see	also	Namkhai	Norbu,	
The	Dzogchen	Ritual
Practices
,	pp.	132-6;	and	for	its	intonation,	ibid.,	pp.	90-1.	Following	the	tantra,
the	syllables	are	interpreted	by	Namkhai	Norbu	as	follows:	From	the	very
beginning	(EMA),	intrinsic	awareness	has	never	been	born,	nor	will	it	ever	be
born	(KIRI	KIRI).	Self-arisen,	it	has	never	been	interrupted	MAṢTA),	nor	will	it
ever	be	interrupted	(BHALIBHALI).	Since	it	is	total	vision,	it	has	never	been
clarified,	nor	will	it	ever	be	clarified	(SAMITASURUSURU).	Being
omnipresent,	it	has	never	been	constructed,	nor	will	it	ever	be	constructed
(KUNDHALIMASUMASU).	Being	unique	it	is	perfectly	realised	in	space
through	the	methods	of	the	four	signs	(EKARILISUBHASTAYE).	It	is	natural
liberation	into	the	great	expanse	and	it	is	supreme	bliss	(CAKIRABHULITA).
Since	it	is	the	great	expanse,	it	is	habituated	to	supreme	delight
(CAYESAMUNTA	CARYASUGHAYE).	Relaxing	the	tension	of	this	portion,
which	is	relative	existence,	intrinsic	awareness	generates	everything
(BHITISANABHYAGHULIYE).	And	thus	one	transfers	directly	into	the	great
inner	radiance	(SAKARIDHUKANI).	Brilliant	and	wondrous,	this	light	radiates
(MATARIBHETANA),	totally	transcending	everything,	and	it	eliminates	all
errors	(PARALIHISANA).	In	a	state	of	being	just	as	it	is,	it	is	free	from	all
conceptions	(MAKHARTEKELANA).	Being	perfect,	it	is	like	the	light	of	the
moon	(SAMBH

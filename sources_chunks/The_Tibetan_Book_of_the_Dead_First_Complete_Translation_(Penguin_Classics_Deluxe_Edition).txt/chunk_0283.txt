de-bzhin	gshegs-pa
A	synonym	for	
buddha
,	used	frequently	in	the	
sūtras
,	which	literally	means
‘One	Who	Has	Thus	Gone’.	The	expression	is	interpreted	in	different	ways,
corresponding	to	the	different	classes	of	
sūtras
	and	
tantras
,	but	in	general	it
implies	‘one	who	has	departed	in	the	wake	of	the	
buddhas
	of	the	past’,	or	‘one
who	has	manifested	the	supreme	
enlightenment
	dependent	on	the	
reality
	that
does	not	abide	in	the	two	extremes	of	existence	and	
quiescence
’.

Those	Gone	to	Bliss
	
bde-bar	gshegs-pa
,	Skt.	
sugata
An	epithet	of	the	
buddhas
.	The	expression	‘those	gone	to	bliss	of	the	three
times’	(
dus-gsum	bde-gshegs
)	refers	to	the	
buddhas
	of	the	past,	present,	and
future,	exemplified	respectively	by

Thread-cross
	
mdos
In	its	simplest	form	a	thread-cross	can	be	two	crossed	sticks	or	a	simple	wooden
frame	(
nam-mkha’
)	around	which	coloured	threads	(
rgyang-bu
)	are	arranged	in	a
diamond	 or	 other	 more	 complex	 pattern.	 Thread-crosses	 vary	 in	 size	 and
complexity	depending	on	the	type	of	ritual	for	which	they	are	constructed.	In
essence,	they	represent	a	‘trap’	for	negative	and	malevolent	forces,	where	the
trap	symbolises	and	is	empowered	with	all	the	qualities	that	can	satisfy	the
negative	or	malevolent	force.	Thus,	the	design	of	the	thread-cross	can	closely
mirror	that	of	a	
stūpa
	
or	three-dimensional	
maṇḍala
	and	represent	the	purity	of
the	psycho-physical	
aggregates
,	
elemental	properties
,	and	sensory	and	mental
processes,	
etc.
	 On	 some	 occasions	 these	 complex	 thread-crosses	 can	 be
enormous	structures	up	to	tens	of	feet	high.

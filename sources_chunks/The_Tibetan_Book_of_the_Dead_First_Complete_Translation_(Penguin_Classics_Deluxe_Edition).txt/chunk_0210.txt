At	this	point	the	text	inserts	the	following	couplet,	which	has	apparently	been
mis-transcribed	out	of	context	from	the	previous	aspirational	prayer:
May	the	fields	of	the	five	elements	not	rise	up	as	a	hostile	force.	May	I	see	them
as	the	fields	of	the	five	buddhas.

Here,	the	intermediate	state	of	reality	(
chos-nyid	bar-do

because	the	luminosities	and	the	Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities	are	directly	seen,
offering	the	potential	for	immediate	liberation.

Although	the	introduction	to	the	intermediate	state	of	rebirth	(

has	already	been	given	(see	Ch.	11,	pp.	273-303),	the	drama	presented	here
functions	as	a	light-hearted	didactic	supplement	to	the	previous	introduction,	and
is	directed	specifically	at	the	living	rather	than	the	deceased.

The	methods	by	which	death	can	be	averted	and	postponed	should	now	be
explained	in	order	that	living	beings	might	be	released	from	suffering,	and	in
order	 that	 all	 the	 unremitting	 and	 extremely	 bitter	 sufferings	 of	 death,	 [in
particular],	might	be	dispelled	by	Mahākāruṇika.

	For,	the	sufferings	of	all	such
beings	[who	are	afflicted	by	the	discomforts	associated	with	death]	may	be
completely	curtailed	[through	ritual	means].	It	is	the	case	that,	for	some	children
of	buddha	nature,	the	signs	of	death	will	arise,	[when	looked	for]	as	described	in
the	previous	chapter.	The	esoteric	instructions	for	averting	[the	signs	which

indicate]	the	swiftly	approaching	year	or	month	[of	death]	consist	of	both	the
general	consolidated	rite	and	specific	rites.
GENERAL	CONSOLIDATED	RITE	FOR	AVERTING	DEATH
The	general	rite	for	averting	death	is	applicable	in	cases	when	the	lifespan	is
threatened	by	obstacle-causing	forces	and	[imbalanced]	elemental	forces.	Now,
the	body	of	a	person	acts	as	a	supporting	frame	for	the	five	elements,	and	it
naturally	comprises	five	appendages,	
five	sense-organs,	five	solid	viscera,	five
hollow	viscera,	and	five	great	energy	channels.	In	each	of	these	[anatomical]
parts,	the	five	elements	circulate	in	a	clockwise	manner,
5
	and	the	cessation	of
life	can	occur	due	to	[external]	circumstances,	or	one	could	die	through	the
mingling	of	conflicting	internal	elements,	or	life	could	also	cease	through	the
agency	 of	 a	 severe	 obstacle-causing	 force.	 The	 [time	 of]	 death	 may	 be
ascertained	by	actually	observing	the	respective	signs	associated	with	these
[three	causes	of	death],	as	and	when	they	manifest.
Immediately	 following	 the	 initial	 experience	 of	 such	 [signs],	 one	 should
perform	the	[appropriate]	rites	for	averting	[death],	which	include	ceremonies,
services,	and	exorcisms.
In	this	regard,	[one	should	know	that]	of	the	twelve	months	of	the	year,	two
are	ruled	by	each	of	the	[five]	elements,	while	the	two	[remaining]	months	are
ruled	[by	all	five	elements]	in	common.	Also,	within	each	of	these	months	[of
the	year]	there	is	a	five-day	period	ruled	by	each	of	the	[five]	elements,	while	the
five	[remaining]	days	are	ruled	[by	all	five	elements]	in	common.	[The	signs	of
death]	 cannot	 be	 averted,	 however,	 when	 an	 [imbalanced]	 elemental	 or
malevolent	force	[completely]	controls	the	body.	Just	as,	for	example,	if	fire
breaks	out	in	a	tall	fortress,	it	is	more	easily	averted	while	it	is	first	confined
within	the	lower	storey,	but	should	it	reach	the	top	[of	the	fortress],	the	fire
cannot	be	extinguished.
A	person	in	whom	the	signs	[of	death]	have	manifested	should	first	make
preliminary	offerings	to	the	spiritual	teacher,	and	to	the	Three	Precious	Jewels,
and	accumulate	as	much	merit	as	possible.	Then,	the	ritual	for	averting	[an
imbalance	in	the	elements]	should	be	effected	through	the	agency	of	the	wheels
and	seed-syllables	of	the	elements.	This	should	be	done	as	follows:	[First],	draw
a	series	of	wheels	[representing	the	elements]	on	Indian	paper	or	palm	leaf.	The

representation	of	the	[green]	wheel	of	the	wind	element
6
	should	depict	four
spokes	and	a	circumference,	with	five	YAṂ	syllables	inscribed,	one	on	each
spoke	and	one	at	the	centre,	and	with	the	vowels	and	consonants	[depicted]	on
the	outer	circumference.
7
	The	red	wheel	of	the	fire	element	should	be	similar	[in
design],	with	four	spokes	etc.,	but	inscribed	with	five	RAṂ	syllables,	placed	as
before,	and	the	vowels	and	consonants	on	its	circumference,	[all	placed]	as
before.	Similarly,	the	yellow	wheel	of	the	earth	element	should	be	depicted	with
five	LAṂ	syllables,	the	white	wheel	of	the	
water	element	with	five	KHAṂ
syllables,	and	the	azure	wheel	of	the	space	element	with	five	E	syllables.	[Then],
on	each	of	these	inscribed	wheels,	one	should	visualise	the	deities	who	embody
the	nature	of	these	elements,	corresponding	in	colour	to	their	respective	wheels.

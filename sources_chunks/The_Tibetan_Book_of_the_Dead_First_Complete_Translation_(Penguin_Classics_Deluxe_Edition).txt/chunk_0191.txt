genuine	reality	(
yang-dag	ji-bzhin-nyid-du
ma-rtogs-pa
)	comprise	the	adherents	of	the	causal	vehicles,	who	maintain	the
views	of	Cittamātra	and	Madhyamaka,	realising	respectively	that	phenomena	are
extensions	 of	 consciousness	 and	 that	 all	 phenomena,	 whether	 external	 or
internal,	are	without	inherent	existence;	yet	not	quite	understanding	that	‘all
things	are	identical	in	primordial	buddhahood’,	or	that	‘neither	renunciation	nor
acceptance	 is	 required	 because	 dissonant	 mental	 states	 themselves	 arise	 as
pristine	cognition’.	At	the	same	time,	all	these	types	are	said	to	be	‘meagre	in
their	skilful	means	(
upāyakauśalya
)’	and	they	‘accomplish	their	results	with
difficulty	and	toil	over	a	long	period	of	time’.	Longchen	Rabjampa	concludes
that	only	the	adherents	of	the	resultant	vehicles	(
phalayāna
)	perceive	genuine
reality	as	it	is,	and	among	these,	only	Atiyoga	is	stated	to	be	the	‘naturally	secret
truth’	(
rang-bzhin	 gsang-ba’i	 don
),	 while	 Kriyātantra	 and	 Ubhayatantra	
are
referred	 to	 as	 ‘disciplines’	 (
’dul-ba
),	 Yogatantra	 as	 ‘enlightened	 intention’

(
dgongs-pa
),	 and	 Mahāyoga	 as	 ‘secrecy’	 (
gsang-ba
).	 These	 diverse
classifications	of	Buddhist	practitioners	and	vehicles	are	identified,	one	by	one,
in	the	following	verses.	For	the	Nyingma	perspective	of	the	non-Buddhist	views
‘of	wrong	understanding’	(
log-rtogs-pa
)	mentioned	above,	see	also	Dudjom
Rinpoche,	NSTB,	pp.	64-7.

The	‘partial	absence	of	self’	(

selflessness	comprehended	by	pious	attendants	and	hermit	buddhas.	See	glossary

This	passage,	in	which	the	texts	(
gzhung
)	and	philosophical	systems
(
siddhānta
;	Tib.	
grub-mtha’
)	of	the	diverse	Buddhist	schools	are	said	to	inhibit
the	perception	of	inner	radiance,	corresponds	closely	to	a	well-known	quotation
from	the	
Tantra	of	the	All-accomplishing	King
	(
Kun-byed	rgyal-po’i	rgyud
,	T
828),	for	a	translation	of	which,	see	Dudjom	Rinpoche,	NSTB,	pp.	295-7.	The
Buddhist	and	non-Buddhist	spiritual	and	philosophical	systems	(
siddhānta
)	are
the	subject	of	detailed	analysis	in	many	specialist	treatises,	among	which	the
Nyingma	presentations	relevant	to	our	present	text	include	Longchen
Rabjampa’s	
Treasury	of	Spiritual	and	Philosophical	Systems
	(

According	to	the	often-cited	passage	from	the	
Tantra	of	the	All-accomplishing
King
	(
Kun-byed	rgyal-po’i	rgyud
,	T	828)	mentioned	above,	the	weaknesses	(
gol-
sa
)	of	these	three	outer	classes	of	tantra	are	respectively:	maintaining	the
subject-object	dichotomy	in	relation	to	purity	(Kriyātantra),	maintaining	the
duality	of	view	and	conduct	(Ubhayatantra),	and	maintaining	acceptance	and
rejection	in	relation	to	meditation	(Yogatantra).	In	the	present	context,	these	are
all	subsumed	in	the	weakness	of	excessive	attachment	to	the	so-called	‘four
branches	of	ritual	service	and	attainment’	(
bsnyen-sgrub	yan-lag	bzhi
),	on	which
see	the	glossary.

The	inner	tantras	of	skilful	means	(
nang-pa	thabs-kyi	rgyud
),	which	are	the
subject	of	the	present	verse,	are	those	of	Mahāyoga,	Anuyoga,	and	Atiyoga,	for	a
detailed	discussion	of	which,	see	Dudjom	Rinpoche,	NSTB,	pp.	273-345,	357-
72.	Of	these	inner	tantras	of	skilful	means,	only	Atiyoga	is	considered	to	be	free

from	weaknesses,	while	the	
Tantra	of	the	All-accomplishing	King
	
(
Kun-byed
rgyal-po’i	rgyud
)	refers	to	the	weakness	in	Mahāyoga	as	‘excessive	perseverance
with	regard	to	ritual	service	and	attainment’	(
sevāsādhana
);	and	to	the	weakness
in	Anuyoga	as	‘the	duality	of	pure	expanse	or	space’	(
dag-pa’i	dbyings
)
identified	with	Samantabhadr
ῑ
,	and	of	pristine	cognition	or	awareness	(
jñāna
),
which	is

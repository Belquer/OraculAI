terror.	Now,	if	you	continue	to	be
distracted,	the	lifeline	of	compassion,	suspended	to	you,	will	be	cut	off	and	you
will	move	on	to	a	place	where	there	is	no	[immediate]	prospect	of	liberation.	So
be	careful.
	
Through	this	introduction,	even	though	[the	deceased]	may	have	failed	to	attain
recognition	 previously,	 he	 or	 she	 will	 be	 able	 to	 do	 so	 at	 this	 stage	 and
consequently	attain	liberation.

If,	however,	[the	deceased]	is	a	lay	person,	who	does	not	know	how	to
meditate,	you	should	say	the	following	words:
	
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	if	you	do	know	how	to	meditate	you	should	call	to
mind	the	Buddha,	the	[sacred]	teachings,	the	[sublime]	assembly	of	monks	and
nuns,	and	[the	meditational	deity]	Mahākāruṇika	and	pray	to	them.	Meditate	on
all	the	fearful	and	terrifying	appearances	as	being	[forms]	of	Mahākāruṇika,	or
your	meditational	deity.	Remember	your	spiritual	teacher	and	remember	the
name	 which	 you	 received	 during	 empowerment	 ceremonies	 in	 the	 human
world.

[Say	this	name	to]	Yama	Dharmarāja	and	do	not	be	afraid	of	him.
[Know	now,	that]	even	if	you	were	to	plunge	down	over	the	precipices,	you
would	not	be	harmed.	So,	abandon	your	fear	and	your	terror.
	
Even	though	liberation	may	not	have	been	achieved	previously,	if	the	above
introduction	is	accepted,	[the	deceased]	will	attain	liberation	at	this	juncture.
Yet,	 since	 there	 is	 the	 possibility	 that	 [the	 deceased]	 will	 not	 achieve
recognition,	even	though	the	introduction	has	been	given,	it	is	very	important	to
persevere.	Therefore,	once	again,	one	should	call	to	the	deceased	by	name	and
say	the	following	words:
	
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	your	present	perceptions	can,	like	a	catapult,	in	a
instant,	cast	you	into	the	most	awesome	states;	either	blissful	or	full	of	suffering.
Therefore,	now,	[it	is	critical	that]	your	perceptions	are	not	coloured	by	either
attachment	or	aversion.
It	may	be	that	you	are	about	to	take	birth	in	the	higher	realms,	yet	at	the	time
when	the	perceptions	of	the	higher	realms	occur,	your	living	relatives,	now	left
behind,	are	sacrificing	and	offering	many	animals	on	your	behalf,	dedicating
[this	activity]	to	you,	the	deceased.	Corrupted	perceptions	will	thus	arise	and
consequently	an	intense	aversion	may	well	up	[within	you],	and	this	will	form	a
connecting	link	to	a	birth	in	the	hell	realms.	Therefore,	whatever	activities	occur
in	the	place	that	you	have	left	behind,	meditate	on	loving	kindness,	and	ensure
that	aversion	does	not	arise!
Alternatively,	your	mind	may	grow	attached	to	your	wealth	and	possessions,
now	left	behind,	or	else,	knowing	that	your	wealth	and	possessions	are	being
enjoyed	and	owned	by	others,	you	may	become	both	attached	to	those	worldly
goods	 and	 also	 hateful	 towards	 those	 left	 behind	 [who	 are	 using	 your

possessions].	As	a	result	of	this,	a	connecting	link	will	certainly	be	formed	to	a
birth	amongst	the	hell	beings	or	amongst	the	anguished	spirits,	even	though	you
may	have	been	at	the	point	of	attaining	birth	in	[one	of]	the	higher	realms.
However	attached	you	may	be	to	the	wealth	now	left	behind,	you	do	not	have	the
ability	 to	 enjoy	 it.	 Since	 it	 is	 absolutely	 of	 no	 use	 to	 you,	 abandon	 your
attachment	and	yearning	for	the	wealth	that	you	have	left	behind.	Let	it	go!	Be
decisive!	Regardless	of	who	is	enjoying	your	wealth,	do	not	be	possessive!	Let	it
go!	 Cultivate	 devotion,	 and	 imagine	 that	 you	 are	 offering	 these	 [worldly
possessions]	to	your	spiritual	teacher	and	to	the	[Three]	Precious	Jewels.	Rest
in	a	state	free	from	attachment	and	free	from	clinging.
Once	again,	even	when	the

recited	 for	 you	 and	 the

perceive,	with	your	present	subtle	cognitive	ability,	that	these	[rites]	are	being
performed	impurely	and	distractedly,	
and	that	those	[who	are	performing	these
rituals]	are	i

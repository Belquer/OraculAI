cies.	 Consequently,	 you	 have
remained	in	your	present	state,	until	now.	If	you	had	previously	recognised	[one
of]	the	natural	luminosities	of	the	pristine	cognitions	of	the	five	enlightened
families	as	being	a	natural	manifestation	[of	actual	reality],	you	would	have
dissolved	into	rainbow	light	[at	the	heart]	of	[one	of]	these	buddha-bodies	of	the
five	respective	enlightened	families,	and	attained	buddhahood,	in	the	Buddha-
body	of	Perfect	Resource.	Yet,	since	you	have	been	unable	to	recognise	these
[experiences]	 as	 being	 natural	 manifestations,	 you	 have	 wandered	 here.
Therefore,	listen	now,	without	distraction.	The	vision	of	the	entire	[peaceful
assembly]	of	the	five	enlightened	families,	together	with	that	which	is	called:
‘the	vision	of	the	four	pristine	cognitions	combined’,
47
	
will	now	come	to	invite
you.	Recognise	this!
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	[at	this	time]	the	four	coloured	
lights,	which	are
the	pure	forms	of	the	four	elements,	will	dawn	before	you;	and,	simultaneously,
the	buddha	Vairocana	and	his	consort	will	arise,	as	before,	from	the	central
Buddha	field	of	the	Pervasive	Seminal	Point	[i.e.	Akaniṣṭha-Ghanavyūha].	[At
that	same	moment],	the	buddha	Vajrasattva	and	his	consort,	surrounded	by	their
retinue,	will	arise	from	the	eastern	Buddha	field	of	Manifest	Joy
	(
Abhirati
)
.	The
buddha	Ratnasambhava	and	his	consort,	together	with	their	retinue,	will	arise
from	the	southern	Buddha	field	of	the	Glorious
	(
Śr
ῑ
mat
)
.	The	buddha	Amitābha
and	his	consort,	together	with	their	retinue,	will	arise	from	the	western	Buddha
field	of	the	Blissful
	(
Sukhāvat
ῑ
)
,	and	the	buddha	Amoghasiddhi	and	his	consort,
together	with	their	retinue,	will	now	arise	before	you	from	the	northern	Buddha
field	[called]	Matrix	of	Enlightened	Activities	[i.e.	Karmaprasiddhi],	[all	arising
together]	out	of	a	space	of	rainbow	light.
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	encircling	these	male	and	female	deities	of	the

five	enlightened	families,	the	male	gatekeepers,	[Trailokya]vijaya,	Yamāntaka,
Hayagr
ῑ
varāja	and	Amṛtakuṇḍalin,	will	also	arise,	together	with	the	female
gatekeepers,	 Aṅkuśā,	 Pāśā,	 Sphoṭā	 and	 Ghaṇṭā.	 In	 addition,	 the	 six
[emanational]	sages	who	are	transcendent	lords,	will	also	appear	before	you:
Indraśakra	who	is	the	sage	of	the	gods,	Vemacitra	who	is	the	sage	of	the
antigods,	Śākyamuni	who	is	the	sage	of	humans,	Sthirasimha	who	is	the	sage	of
the	 animals,	 Jvālamukha	 who	 is	 the	 sage	 of	 the	 anguished	 spirits,	 and
Dharmarāja	 who	 is	 the	 sage	 of	 the	 hell	 beings.	 [Accompanying	 the	 above
array],	Samantabhadra	and	Samantabhadr
ῑ
	will	also	arise	before	you,	[in	the
form	called]	Samantabhadra	and	Consort	in	Union,	[the	coalescence]	which	is
the	progenitor	of	all	the	buddhas.
These,	 the	 forty-two	 assembled	 deities	 of	 the	 Buddha-body	 of	 Perfect
Resource,	will	emanate	from	within	your	heart	and	then	appear	before	you.
Recognise	them!	For	they	have	arisen	from	within	your	own	pure	vision!	O,
Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	these	buddha	fields	do	not	exist	extraneously.	They	are
the	five	aspects	of	your	own	heart;	its	four	directions	and	centre.	Emanating	now
from	within	your	own	heart,	they	have	arisen	before	you.	These	buddha-bodies
have	not	arisen	extraneously.	They	have	spontaneously	arisen,	atemporally,	from
the	natural	expressive	power	of	your	own	awareness.	Therefore	recognise	them
as	they	are!
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	these	buddha-bodies	[that	you	see	before	you]	are
neither	large	nor	small,	but	perfectly	proportioned,	and	they	are	[all	adorned]
with	 their	 respective	 ornaments,	 [costumes],	 colours,	 postures,	 thrones	 and
hand-gestures.	The	array	is	made	up	of	[central]	couples	[of	male	and	female
deities],	forming	five	distinct	clusters,	and	each	cluster	of	five	is	encircled	by	an
aura	of	five-coloured	lights.	All	the	male	bodhisattvas	of	the	[five]	enlightened
families	who	accompany	the	male	[buddhas],	all	the	female	bodhisattvas	of	the
[five]	enlightened	families	who	accompany	the	fem

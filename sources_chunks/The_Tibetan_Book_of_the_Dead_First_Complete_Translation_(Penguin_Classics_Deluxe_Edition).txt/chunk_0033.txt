ary	persons	do	not	understand	[the	meaning	of	the	term
‘mind’],
And	do	not	intuitively	recognise	its	nature,
They	continue	to	roam	through	the	six	classes	of	sentient	[rebirth]	within	the
three	world-systems,
And	consequently	experience	suffering.
6
This	is	the	fault	of	not	understanding	this	intrinsic	nature	of	mind.
	
Even	though	pious	attendants	and	hermit	buddhas	claim	that	they	understand
[this	single	nature	of	mind]	as	the	partial	absence	of	self,
7
They	do	not	understand	it	exactly	as	it	is.
Furthermore,	 being	 fettered	 by	 opinions	 held	 in	 accordance	 with	 their
respective	literatures	and	philosophical	systems,
8
There	are	those	who	do	not	perceive	the	inner	radiance	[directly]:
The	pious	attendants	and	hermit	buddhas	are	obscured	[in	this	respect]	by
their	attachment	to	the	subject-object	dichotomy.
The	 adherents	 of	 Madhyamaka	 are	 obscured	 by	 their	 attachment	 to	 the
extremes	of	the	two	truths.
The	 practitioners	 of	 Kriyātantra	 and	 Yogatantra	 are	 obscured	 by	 their
attachment	to	the	extremes	of	ritual	service	and	attainment.
9
The	practitioners	of	Mahāyoga	and	Anuyoga	are	obscured	by	their	attachment
to	[the	extremes	of]	space	and	awareness.
10
All	these	[practitioners]	stray	from	the	point	because	they	polarise	the	non-
dual	reality,
And	since	they	fail	to	unify	[these	extremes]	in	non-duality,	they	do	not	attain
buddhahood.
Thus,	all	of	those	beings	continue	to	roam	in	cyclic	existence,
Because	they	persistently	engage	in	[forms	of]	renunciation,
And	in	acts	of	rejection	and	acceptance	with	regard	to	their	own	minds,
Where	[in	reality]	cyclic	existence	and	nirvāṇa	are	inseparable.
	
Therefore,	one	should	abandon	all	constructed	teachings,
And	all	[unnatural]	states	free	from	activity,

And,	 by	 virtue	 of	 this	
[Introduction	 to]	 Awareness:	 Natural	 Liberation
through	Naked	Perception
,	which	is	presented	here,
One	should	realise	all	things	in	the	context	of	this	great	natural	liberation.
So	it	is	that	all	[enlightened	attributes]	are	brought	to	completion	within	the
Great	Perfection.

[SYNONYMS	FOR	MIND]
As	for	this	apparent	and	distinct	[phenomenon]	which	is	called	‘mind’:
In	terms	of	existence,	it	has	no	[inherent]	existence	whatsoever.
In	terms	of	origination,	it	is	the	source	of	the	diverse	joys	and	sorrows	of
cyclic	existence	and	nirvāṇa,
In	terms	of	[philosophical]	opinion,	it	is	subject	to	opinions	in	accordance
with	the	eleven	vehicles.
In	terms	of	designation,	it	has	an	inconceivable	number	of	distinct	names:
Some	call	it	‘the	nature	of	mind’,	the	‘nature	of	mind	itself’,
Some	eternalists	give	it	the	name	‘self’,
Pious	attendants	call	it	‘selflessness	of	the	individual’,
11
Cittamātrins	call	it	‘mind’,
Some	call	it	the	‘Perfection	of	Discriminative	Awareness’,
Some	call	it	the	‘Nucleus	of	the	Sugata’,
Some	call	it	the	‘Great	Seal’,
Some	call	it	the	‘Unique	Seminal	Point’,
Some	call	it	the	‘Expanse	of	Reality’,
Some	call	it	the	‘Ground-of-all’,
And	some	call	it	‘ordinary	[unfabricated	consciousness]’.
[THE	THREE	CONSIDERATIONS]
The	following	is	the	introduction	[to	the	means	of	experiencing]	this	[single]
nature	[of	mind]
Through	the	application	of	three	considerations:
[First,	recognise	that]	past	thoughts	are	traceless,	clear,	and	empty,

[Second,	recognise	that]	future	thoughts	are	unproduced	and	fresh,
And	 [third,	 recognise	 that]	 the	 present	 moment	 abides	 naturally	 and
unconstructed.
When	 this	 ordinary,	 momentary	 consciousness	 is	 examined	 nakedly	 [and
directly]	by	oneself,
Upon	examination,	it	is	a	radiant	awareness,
Which	is	free	from	the	presence	of	an	observer,
Manifestly	stark	and	clear,
Completely	empty	and	uncreated	in	all	respects,
Lucid,	without	duality	of	radiance	and	emptiness,
Not	permanent,	for	it	is	lacking	inherent	existence	in	all	respects,
Not	a	mere	nothingness,	for	it	is	radiant	and	clear,
Not	a	single	entity,	for	it	is	clearly	perceptible	as	a	multiplicity,
Yet	not	existing	inherently	as	a	multiplicity,	for	it	is	indivis

	school.
According	to	this	view,	all	things	and	events,	both	external	and	internal,	are
devoid	 of	 any	 independent,	 intrinsic	 reality	 that	 constitutes	 their	 essence.
Nothing	can	be	said	to	exist	independently	from	the	complex	network	of	factors
that	 gives	 rise	 to	 their	 origination,	 nor	 are	 phenomena	 independent	 of	 the
cognitive	processes	and	conceptual	designations	(mental	constructs)	that	make
up	the	conventional	framework	within	which	their	identity	and	existence	are
posited.	It	is	our	deeply	ingrained	tendency	to	conceive	of	things	as	materially
existing	in	their	own	right	that	conditions	and	compels	us	to	perceive	
and	grasp
at	a	substantial	reality	of	things	and	our	own	existence.	In	turn,	when	all	levels
of	conceptualisation	dissolve	and	when	all	forms	of	dichotomising	tendencies
are	 quelled	 through	 deliberate	 meditative	 deconstruction	 of	
conceptual

elaborations

	argues,	the	ultimate	nature	of	reality	-	the	emptiness	-
will	finally	become	manifest	to	the	person.	Although	the	term	is	known	also	in
the	literature	of	the	
Lesser	Vehicle
,	it	is	in	the	philosophical	tenets	of	the
Madhyamaka
	school	that	the	different	interpretations	of	emptiness	were	greatly
elaborated.	See

Energy	Centre

cakra
According	to	the	
tantras
	and	related	medical	traditions,	there	are	five	energy
centres	within	the	
subtle	body
.	These	are	located	at	the	crown,	throat,	heart,
navel	and	genitalia,	where	the	right	and	left	channels	are	said	to	loop	around	the
central	channel	(
avadhūti
),	forming	knots	(
rtsa-mdud
)	which	obstruct	the	flow	of
subtle	energy	into	the	central	channel.	At	each	of	the	five	energy	centres,	there
are	a	diverse	number	of	
channel	branches
	(
rtsa-’dab
),	through	which	vital
energy	is	conducted	throughout	the	body.

In	the	
tantras
	and	related	medical	traditions,	it	is	said	that	there	are	72,000	vein-
like	channels	through	which	flow	the	
vital	energies
	or	subtle	winds	(
rlung
,	Skt.
vāyu
)	that	sustain	life	and	which	also	give	rise	to	various	conceptual	states
within	the	individual’s	mind.	Three	main	channels	run	vertically	from	the	crown
fontanelle	of	the	head	down	to	the	genitalia,	intersecting	at	the	five	
energy
centres
	(Skt.	
cakra
)	of	the	crown,	throat,	heart,	navel	and	genitalia.	All	the
minor	energy	channels	branch	off	from	these	
energy	centres
	to	permeate	the
body.	Among	the	three	main	channels,	the	one	to	the	left	is	known	as	the	
rkyang-
ma
	(Skt.	
lalanā
),	the	one	to	the	right	as	the	
ro-ma
	(Skt.	
rasanā
),	and	the	central
channel	as	the	
dbu-ma
	(Skt.

).

In	the	context	of	our	text,	enlightened	intention	refers	to	the	unimpeded,	non-
conceptual	and	compassionate	intention	of	the	
buddhas
,	whether	or	not	it	is

clearly	discerned	by	an	observer.
	
Enlightenment
	
byang-chub
,	Skt.	
bodhi
In	the	Buddhist	context,	‘enlightenment’	refers	to	an	individual’s	awakening	to
the	 mind’s	 actual	 nature.	 The	 Tibetan	 equivalent	
byang-chub
	 implies	 the
purification
	
(
byang
)	of	
obscurations
	and	the	perfection	(
chub
)	of	
omniscience
.
The	process	of	attaining	enlightenment	therefore	proceeds	in	conjunction	with
the	dispelling	of	the	
dissonant	mental	states
	which	obscure	the	perception	of
actual	 reality
.	 On	 the	
bodhisattva
	 path,	 thirty-seven	 distinct	 aspects	 of
enlightenment	are	sequentially	cultivated.	A	fully	enlightened	being	is	a

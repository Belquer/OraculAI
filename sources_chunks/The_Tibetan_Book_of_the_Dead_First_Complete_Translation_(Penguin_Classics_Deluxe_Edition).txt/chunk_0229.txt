loved.	It	is	worth	bearing	in	mind	that	in	Buddhism,	compassion
should	 not	 be	 understood	 in	 terms	 of	 pity,	 which	 may	 imply	 a	 feeling	 of
superiority	toward	the	object	of	compassion.
	
Conceptual	Elaboration
	
spros-pa
,	Skt.	
prapañca
Conceptual	elaboration	refers	to	the	presence	of	discursive	or	conceptual	thought
processes,	 the	 absence	 of	 which	 (Skt.	
nisprapañca
,	 Tib.	
spros-bral
)	 is
characteristic	of	the	realisation	of	
emptiness
	or	
actual	reality
.
	
Confession	of	Negativity
	
sdig-pa’i	gshags-pa
,	Skt.	
pāpadeśanā
A	 spiritual	 practice	 which	 involves	 the	 disclosure	 and	 purification	 of
accumulated	
negative	actions.	The	successful	application	of	confession	must	be
undertaken	 within	 the	 framework	 of	 what	 are	 known	 as	 the	 four	 antidotal
powers.	For	an	explanation	of	these	see	the	introductory	context	to	Chapter	7.
	
Conqueror
	
rgyal-ba
,	Skt
.	jina
In	Buddhist	literature,	this	term	is	an	epithet	for	a	
buddha
,	indicating	the	victory
attained	by	a	
buddha
	over	
cyclic	existence
	(
samsāra
).	 In	 particular	 in	 the
context	of	this	book,	the	
Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource
	in	the	
maṇdala
	of
the	
Peacefuland	Wrathful	Deities
	 is	 described	 as	 represented	 by	 the	
‘five
enlightened	families
	of	the	conquerors’	(
rgyal-ba	rigs-lnga
),	where	the	five
male	
buddhas
,	in	both	peaceful	and	wrathful	forms,	are	known	as	the	five
conquerors.	
Vajradhara
,	an	aspect	of	the	primordial	
buddha	Samantabhadra
,
who	 represents	 the	
Buddha-body	 of	 Reality
,	 is	 also	 known	 as	 the	 ‘sixth
conqueror’	(
rgyal-ba	drug-pa
)	or	‘lord	of	the	sixth	
enlightened	family’
.	More
generally,	in	its	Tibetan	form,	this	same	epithet	is	frequently	used	as	an	honorific
title	before	the	names	of	highly	venerated	beings,	
e.g.
	
Gyalwa	Yizhin	Norbu
	(for
HH	the	
Dalai	Lama
),	or	
Gyalwa	Karmapa
.
	
Consciousness
	
rnam-par	shes-pa
,	Skt.	
vijñāna
In	Buddhism,	consciousness	is	defined	as	‘an	awareness	which	is	knowing	and
luminous’.	It	is	not	physical	and	thus	lacks	any	resistance	to	obstruction.	It	has
neither	shape	nor	colour;	it	can	be	experienced	but	not	externally	perceived	as	an
object.	 In	 short,	 it	 includes	 both	 the	 conscious	 cognitive	 events	 and	 the
subconscious	aspects	of	the	mind	through	which	we	know	and	perceive	the
world,	as	well	as	the	emotions.	A	distinction	is	made	between	the	mundane

consciousness	(
vijñāna
)	of	sentient	beings,	and	the	
pristine	cognition
	(
jñāna
)	of
the	
buddhas
.	See	
Pristine	Cognition
	and	
Aggregate	of	Consciousness
.
	
Consciousness	Transference
	
’pho-ba
,	Skt.	
samkrānti
A	unique	tantric	practice	undertaken	to	transfer	the	
consciousness
	at	the	time	of
death,	ideally	to	the	unconditioned	state	of	the	realisation	of	the	
Buddha-body
of	
Reality
,	or	to	a	realm	of	existence	with	a	favourable	migration,	ideally	the
pure	realm
	of	a	
meditational	deity.
	See	Chapter	10.
	
Continuum	of	the	Ground
	
gzhi’i	rgyud
,	Skt
.	āśrayatantra
The	continuum	of	the	ground	is	identified	with	the	primordially	present	intrinsic
awareness
,	and	the	
actual	reality
	or	
emptiness
,	which	is	in	harmony	with	the
fruitional	aspects	of	
buddhahood
.	According	to	the	
tantras
,	the	continuum	of
the	ground	(
gzhi’i	rgyud
)	is	the	basis	through	which	the	
continuum	of	the	path
(
lam-gyi	rgyud
)	fully	manifests	as	the	
continuum	of	the	result
	(
’bras-bu’i
rgyud
).

,	Skt

	 (

)	 becomes	 fully
manifest	through	the	
continuum	of	the	path
	(
lam-gyi	rgyud

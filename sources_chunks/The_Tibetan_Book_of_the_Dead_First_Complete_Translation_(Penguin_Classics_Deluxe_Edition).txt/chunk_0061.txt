ally	purified,
without	being	renounced,	the	[following]	
Natural	Liberation	through	Acts	of
Confession,	in	the	Presence	of	the	Peace	ful	and	Wrath	ful	Deities
,	which	is	an
extract	from	the	
Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities:	Natural	Liberation	through
[Recognition	of]	Enlightened	Intention
,	is	[now]	presented.	Be	persevering	in
this	regard,	O	Children	of	Posterity!	SAMAYA!
	
This	[confessional	practice]	is	presented	in	six	parts,	namely:	confession	[in	the
presence]	of	the	inexpressible	truth,	confession	in	the	presence	of	the	Peaceful
Deities,	 confession	 in	 the	 presence	 of	 the	 Wrathful	 Deities,	 the	 plaintive
confession	of	rampant	egohood,	confession	in	the	presence	of	the	view,	and
confession	[in	the	presence]	of	all	Those	Gone	to	Bliss.
PRELIMINARIES
The	invitation	and	request	for	[the	confessional	field]	to	be	present
	
OṂO,	supreme	buddha-body	of	pristine	cognition,
Even	though,	like	the	[clarity	of	the]	waxing	moon,
You	are	free	from	conceptual	elaboration	in	this	natural	maṇḍala,
Your	compassion	[radiates	to	all]	without	bias,	like	the	rays	of	the	sun.
Please	be	present	here,	and	attend	to	us!
	
The	homage	to	the	three	buddha-bodies,	which	compose	the	Peace	ful	and

Wrathful	Deities
	
I	bow	down	to	the	three	buddha-bodies	of	the	Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities:
To	 the	 Buddha-body	 of	 Reality,	 the	 inexpressible	 and	 unwavering
discriminative	awareness,
To	the	supremely	blissful	Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource,	the	lords	of	the
five	enlightened	families,
And	to	the	Buddha-body	of	Emanation:	extensive,	compassionate	and	skilful.
	
The	three	fold	of	fering	of	[outer]	phenomena,	[inner]	cloud-masses,	and	secret
[substances]
	
By	arraying	the	vast	and	pure	expanse	of	space,
With	[billowing]	clouds	of	unsurpassed	Samantabhadra-like	offerings,
Whether	they	be	actually	gathered	together	or	imagined,
We	dedicate	[to	you]	oceans	of	outer,	inner	and	secret	offerings.

The	secret	of	fering	of	supreme	bliss
	
May	[the	deities]	be	delighted	by	the	non-dual	‘generative	essence’
4
Whose	[blissful]	single	savour	indicates	a	[pristine]	state,
Where	all	the	infinite	maṇḍalas	of	the	conquerors,	without	exception,
Are	established,	beyond	conjunction	or	disjunction,
In	the	secret	womb	of	Samantabhadr
ῑ.
	
The	affirmation	of	vows	within	the	modality	of	the	view
	
Since	the	nature	of	mind	is	the	great	expanse	of	reality,
And	all	things	are	pure	atemporal	inner	radiance,
This	yoga	is	itself	the	inexpressible	and	inconceivable	expanse.
Everlastingly	we	bow	down	to	the	mind	of	enlightenment,
Which	is	[the	realisation	of]	sameness!
	
The	call	to	the	assembly	of	Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities	for	attention
	

ĀḤ	 In	 the	 atemporal	 omnipresence	 of	 the	 Great	 Perfection,	 which	 is
Samantabhadra,
Is	[displayed]	the	maṇḍala	of	the	outer,	inner,	and	secret	arrays.
Here,	 the	 expanse	 of	 male	 and	 female	 deities	 is	 the	 [natural]	 purity	 of
mundane	existence,
And	the	spontaneously	perfect	male	and	female	consorts	are	the	[natural
purity]	of	past	and	future	[events].
All	 of	 these	 are	 centred	 in	 the	 ‘lotus	 of	 vast	 space’,	 which	 is	 that	 of
[Samantabhadr
ῑ
],
She	who	embodies	the	most	secret	and	most	joyous	of	supreme	forms.
Within	this	[space,	the	maṇḍala]	radiates	as	a	supreme	non-dual	seminal	point,
And	within	this	secret	maṇḍala,	where	there	is	no	conjunction	or	disjunction,
Is	[arrayed]	the	buddha-body	of	the	uncontrived	nucleus	of	enlightenment,
free	from	conceptual	elaboration,
Where	the	immutable	deities	of	supreme	bliss	manifest	in	myriad	forms.
O,	 you	 manifold	 assembly	 of	 [peaceful]	 emanations,	 present	 within	 the
indivisible	expanse,
Including	the	male	and	female	[buddhas]	of	the	five	enlightened	families,	who
are	the	Great	Embodiment,
The	[sixteen]	male	and	female	bodhisattvas,	and	the	six	sages	who	instruct
living	beings,
Along	with	the	eight	emanational	gatekeepers,	male	and	female;
O,	you	manifold	[wrathful]	assembly	of	the	emanational	deities	of	pristine
cognition,
[Including]	the	ten	male	and	fe

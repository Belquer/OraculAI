earlier	phase	of	dissemination,	they	are	classified	into
Mahāyoga
,	
Anuyoga
	and	
Atiyoga
,	whereas	the	later	schools	classify	them	into
Father,	Mother	and	Non-dual	or	Indivisible	
tantras

Uṣṇīṣavijayā
	
gtsug-gtor	rnam-rgyal-ma
One	 of	 the	 three	 principal	 meditational	 deities	 associated	 with	 longevity
practices	and	the	subject	of	five	principal	
dhāraṇ
ῑ
	incarnations,	
Uṣṇ
ῑ

generally	assumes	a	slightly	wrathful	appearance,	with	three	faces	(white,	yellow
and	pale	blue)	and	eight	arms	holding	diverse	symbolic	implements.	She	is

Vaiḍūryaprabharāja
	
sang-rgyas	sman-bla
The	
Buddha
	of	Medicine,	the	principal	figure	in	the	Buddhist	medical	
tantras
,
who	is	regarded	as	the	progenitor	of	the	
Four	Tantras	of	Medicine
	(
rGyud-bzhi
).
According	to	certain	sources	
Śākyamuni	Buddha
	is	believed	to	have	assumed	a
specific	form	when	teaching	the	medical	
tantras
	and	that	aspect	of	the	
Buddha
is	called	
Vaiḍūryaprabharāja
,	the	‘King	of	Blue	Beryl	Light’.	He	is	normally
depicted	in	paintings	as	being	blue	in	colour	and	holding	in	his	left	palm	an	alms
bowl	filled	with	the	fruits	of	a	medicinal	plant,	chebulic	myrobalan.	According
to	the	
lineage
	
of	the	medical	
tantras
,	there	are	eight	different	aspects	of	the
Medicine	
Buddha
,	of	which	
Vaiḍūryaprabharāja
	is	the	foremost.
	
Vajra
	
rdo-rje
In	the	sense	of	
rdo-rje	pha-lam
	(pronounced	‘
dorje	phalam
’),	this	term	means
the	diamond,	literally	‘the	sovereign	among	all	stones’.	In	Buddhism	however
rdo-rje
	
indicates	the	indestructible	reality	of	
buddhahood
,	which	is	defined	as
both	imperishable	(
mi-gshigs
)	and	indivisible	(
ma-phyed
).	The	emblem	symbolic
of	this	indestructible	reality	is	also	known	as	
rdo-rje
	or	
vajra
.	This	is	a	sceptre-
like	
tantric
	ritual	object	which	is	held	in	the	right	palm	usually	whenever	playing
a	ritual	bell.	The	sceptre	symbolises	
skilful	means
	and	the	bell	
discriminative
awareness
.	Holding	these	together	in	the	two	palms	represents	the	perfect	union
of	
discriminative	awareness
	and	
skilful	means
.	
Vajrā
,	also	known	as	
Piṅgalā
(
dmar-mo
),	is	the	name	given	to	the	first	of	the	six	
yogin
ῑ
	from	the	south,	a
subcategory	of	the	twenty-eight	
Īśvar
ῑ
.	See	Appendix	Two.
	
Vajra-brothers	and	sisters
	
rdo-rje	ming-sring
The	most	intimate	of	spiritual	siblings	(
mched-grogs
),	with	whom	one	shares
empowerments
	and	
commitments
.	See	
Spiritual	Sibling
.
	
Vajra	Family
	
rdo-rje’i	rigs
,	Skt.	
vajrakula
One	of	the	
five	enlightened	families
	(
pañcakula
)	into	which	the	
meditational
deities
	
of	the	
Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource
	are	subdivided.	The	deities	of
the	
Vajra
	
family	 include	 the	 peaceful	
buddhas
	
Akṣobhya-Vajrasattva
	 and
Buddhalocanā
	 and	 the	 corresponding	 wrathful	 aspects	
Vajra	 Heruka
	 and
Vajrakrodheśvar
ῑ
.	See	Appendix	Two.

	
Vajra-master
	
rdo-rje	slob-dpon
,	Skt.	
vajrācārya
The	 ‘master	 of	 indestructible	 reality’	 who	 presides	 over	
empowerment
ceremonies	
and	the	related	ritual	dances	of	the	great	
means	for	attainment

,	Tib.	
sgrub-chen
),	embodying	the	central	
meditational	deity
	of
the	
maṇḍala
.
	
Vajradhara
	
rdo-rje	’chang
Vajradhara
	(lit.	‘vajra-holder’)	is	an	expression	of	the	
Buddha-body	of	Reality
,
spontaneously	arising	from	the	pure,	pristine	expanse	of	
inner	radiance
,	in	a
form	 complete	 with	 all	 the	 characteristics	 of	 the	
Buddha-body	 of	 Perfect
Resource
.	
Vajradhara
	
is	thus	regarded	as	the	root	of	all	the	
five	enlightened
families
	and	consequently	he	is	also	known	as	the	lord	of	the	sixth	
enlightened
family
.	Many	
tantra
	
texts	and	
lineages
	attribute	their	origin	directly	to	the
Buddha-body	of	Reality
	-	represented	in	the	form	of	either	
Samantabhadra
	or
Vajradhara
.	Other	
tantra
	texts	and	
lineages
	claim	that	
Vajradhara
	is	a	form
assumed	 by	
Śākyamuni	Buddha
	 when	 giving	 esoteric	 teachings	 on	
tantra
.
Vajradhara
	 is	 said	 to	 becom

ied.	 This,	 in	 reality,	 is	 the	 transcendent	 lord
Amoghasiddhi	 and	 his	
consort,	 so	 regard	 them	 with	 intense	 devotion!
Recognition	and	liberation	will	occur	simultaneously!
	
If,	upon	hearing	these	words,	[the	deceased]	recognises	the	meditational	deities,
he	or	she	will	dissolve	indivisibly	[with	them]	and	thereby	attain	buddhahood	[in
the	Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource].
Based	on	the	spiritual	teacher’s	[former]	oral	instruction,	as	one	recognises
these	[visionary	appearances]	as	the	natural	expressive	power	of	awareness,
naturally	manifesting,	liberation	will	occur.	This	is	like	one	who	recognises	a
stuffed	lion-skin	to	be	a	stuffed	lion.	The	nature	of	the	stuffed	lion	is	such	that	if
its	actual	nature	is	not	recognised	it	will	generate	awe	and	terror.	But,	as	soon	as
someone	points	out	what	this	really	is,	the	façade	is	penetrated,	and	the	fear
dissolves.	Similarly,	here,	when	the	assembly	of	blood-drinking	deities	arises,
with	their	huge	bodies	and	thick	limbs,	filling	the	whole	of	space,	[the	deceased]
undoubtedly	becomes	awed	and	terrified.	But,	immediately	upon	hearing	this
introduction,	 the	 deceased	 will	 recognise	 the	 appearances	 to	 be	 natural
manifestations	[of	actual	reality],	or	to	be	their	own	meditational	deities.	[As	this
recognition	 occurs,]	 the	 two	 [aspects	 of	 inner	 radiance],	 the	 ‘mother	 inner
radiance’,	 which	 was	 formerly	 [introduced]	 through	 the	 spiritual	 teacher’s
guidance,	and	the	‘naturally	arising	child	inner	radiance’,	[the	experience	of]
which	emerges	subsequently	[as	the	result	of	practice],	meet	together	-	in	other
words,	like	meeting	an	old	friend,	[the	inner	radiance]	that	dawns	face	to	face
with	oneself	does	so	in	a	naturally	liberating	manner	and	one	will	be	naturally
freed	within	[the	expanse	of]	naturally	radiant	intrinsic	awareness.
If	this	introduction	is	not	received,	even	good	persons	may	turn	away	at	this

point	and	continue	to	roam	within	cyclic	existence.	[As	this	occurs]	then,	the
female	wrathful	deities,	the	eight	Gaur
ῑ
,	and	the	eight	Piśāc
ῑ
,	[the	latter]	having
diverse	[animal]	heads,	will	emerge	from	within	the	brain	[of	the	deceased],	and
appear	before	him	or	her.	Again,	calling	the	deceased	by	name,	the	introduction
should	be	given	in	the	following	words:
	
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	listen	without	distraction!	The	eight	Gaur
ῑ
	will	now
be	emerging	from	within	your	own	brain	and	appearing	before	you.	Do	not	be
afraid!	From	the	eastern	direction	
of	your	brain	the	white	Gaur
ῑ
,	holding	a
human	corpse	as	a	cudgel	in	her	right	hand	and	a	blood-filled	skull	in	her	left
hand,	will	arise	before	you.	Do	not	be	afraid!	From	the	southern	direction,	the
yellow	Caur
ῑ
,	shooting	an	arrow	from	a	bow;	from	the	west,	the	red	Pramohā,
holding	a	crocodile	victory-banner;	and	from	the	north,	the	black	Vetāl
ῑ
,	holding
a	vajra	and	a	blood-filled	skull,	[will	arise].	From	the	south-east,	the	red-yellow
Pukkas
ῑ
,	holding	entrails	in	her	right	[hand]	and	eating	them	with	her	left;	from
the	south-west,	the	green-black	Ghasmar
ῑ
,	holding	a	blood-filled	skull	in	her	left
[hand],	stirring	this	with	a	vajra	in	her	right	hand	and	drinking	awesomely;
from	the	north-west,	the	white-yellow	Caṇḍāl
ῑ
,	tearing	apart	the	head	and	body
[of	a	bloated	corpse],	holding	the	heart	in	her	right	hand	and	eating	the	body
with	her	left;	and	from	the	north-east,	the	blue-black	Śmaśān
ῑ
,	tearing	a	head
and	body	apart	and	eating	them,	[will	arise].	These	eight	Gaur
ῑ
,	who	are
indicative	of	the	[eight]	classes	[of	consciousness],	will	emerge	from	within	your
own	brain,	and	surround	the	five	blood-drinking	deities	and	their	consorts.	Do
not	be	afraid!
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	listen	without	distraction!	The	eight	Piśāc
ῑ
,	who
are	 indicative	 of	 the	 sense	 objects,	 will	 emerge,	 and	 appear	 before	 you,
encircling	this	array.	From	the	east,	the	dark	brown	Siṃhamukh
ῑ
,	lion-headed,
her	two	arms	crossed	on	her	breast,	carrying	a	corpse	in	her	mouth	and	shaking
her	mane;

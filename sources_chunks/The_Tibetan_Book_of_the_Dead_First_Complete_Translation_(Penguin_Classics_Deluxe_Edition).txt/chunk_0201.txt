The	following	series	of	signs	of	near	death	are	observed	in	the	urine
specimen.	Note	that	whereas	here	it	is	the	urine	scum	(
spris-ma
)	that	appears
blue	or	red,	in	Ch.	8,	p.	170,	these	colours	are	attributed	to	the	urine	vapour
(

The	combination	of	the	five	elements	(

year-signs	is	an	important	feature	of	elemental	divination	(

which	see	G.	Dorje,

The	Delhi	reprint	adds	an	annotation	to	the	effect	that	this	is	also	applicable	if

At	this	point,	the	various	versions	of	our	text	include	the	following	paragraph:
‘In	cases	when	[one’s	shadow]	is	missing	from	the	neck	upwards,	one	should
visualise	the	syllable	YAṂ	in	the	subject’s	heart,	and	gaze	upwards	as	high	as
one	can.	[Death]	will	then	be	averted	if	one	performs	ablutions	from	the	crown
downwards	with	water	[empowered	by]	mantras	of	retention.’	This	observation

appears	to	be	misplaced,	referring	as	it	does	to	the	analysis	of	the	optically
projected	shadow	rather	than	the	humming	of	the	ears.

(

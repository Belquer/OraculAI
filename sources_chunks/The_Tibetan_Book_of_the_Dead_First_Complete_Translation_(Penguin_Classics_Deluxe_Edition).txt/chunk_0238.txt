Feast-offering
	
tshogs	[kyi	’khor-lo]

The	Tibetan	word	
tshogs
	generally	has	two	senses,	corresponding	to	the	Sanskrit
sambhāra
	and	
gaṇacakra
.	In	the	latter	case	it	refers	to	the	feast-offerings	which
are	 a	 unique	 tantric	 method	 for	 conferring	
accomplishment
	 and	 pacifying
obstacles.	 In	 general,	 feast-offerings	 are	 frequently	 held	 to	 commemorate
important	events	in	the	Buddhist	calendar,	such	as	the	tenth-day	feast-offering,
dedicated	to	
Padmasambhava
	
.	The	overall	purpose	is	to	distribute	
merit
	and
pristine	cognition
	in	the	context	of	a	specific	
tantric
	ritual.	See	also	under

buddhas

Five	Elements
	
’byung-ba	lnga	/	khams	lnga
,	Skt.	
pañcabhūta/	pañcadhātu
According	to	the	Indo-Tibetan	system,	as	expounded	in	the	
tantras
,	and	in
medical	
and	astrological	texts,	the	five	elements	-	earth,	water,	fire,	wind,	and
space	-	are	five	basic	components	that	make	up	our	environment,	our	bodies,
and,	at	their	subtle	levels,	modalities	of	the	mind.	At	the	subtlest	level,	the
elemental	properties	exist	as	the	pure	natures	represented	by	the	five	female
buddhas
	 (
Akāśadhātv
ῑ
śvar
ῑ
,	
Buddhalocanā
,	
Māmak
ῑ
,	
Pāṇḍaravāsin
ῑ
	 and
Samayatārā
)	and	these	manifest	as	the	physical	properties	of	earth	(solidity),
water	(fluidity),	fire	(heat	and	light),	wind	(movement	and	energy),	and	space	-
in	other	words	as	all	the	qualities	that	constitute	the	physical	forms	that	we
experience	through	our	senses.	A	proper	understanding	of	the	elements	and	the
way	in	which	their	properties	permeate	the	nature	of	mind,	the	body	and	our
environment	is	fundamental	to	the	practice	of	Buddhist

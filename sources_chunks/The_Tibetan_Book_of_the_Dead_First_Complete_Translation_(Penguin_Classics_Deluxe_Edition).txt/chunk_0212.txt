ing	everything,	and	it	eliminates	all
errors	(PARALIHISANA).	In	a	state	of	being	just	as	it	is,	it	is	free	from	all
conceptions	(MAKHARTEKELANA).	Being	perfect,	it	is	like	the	light	of	the
moon	(SAMBHURATA	MAIKACARATAMBA).	Like	the	sunlight,	it	is
luminous	(SURYAGHATARAYE	BASHANA).	It	is	like	a	jewel,	a	mountain,	a
many-petalled	lotus	(RANABHITI	SAGHUTIPAYA).	It	is	the	great	resonance
which	has	never	been	sounded,	and	never	will	be	sounded
(GHURAGHURAPAGAKHARANALAM).	It	is	the	primordial	state	which	has
never	been	created	and	never	will	be	created	(NARANARAYI
THARAPAṬLAṂ).	It	is	the	great	enlightened	mind	which	was	never	adorned
and	never	will	be	adorned	(SIRNASIRNABHESARASPALAṂ).	Self-originated
and	perfect,	it	will	never	become	enlightened	(BUDDHABUDDHA
CHIŚASAGHELAṂ).	Ten	concluding	syllables	are	focal	points	of	bodily
energy	(SASĀ	ṚṜ	ḶḸ	IĪ	MAMĀ),	while	the	other	concluding	syllables	are
associated	with	the	buddha-bodies	(RARĀ	LAHA	Ā).

This	mantra	in	the	form	of	a	vajra-song	is	included	in	the	
Tantra	of	the
Coalescence	of	Sun	and	Moon
	(
Nyi-zla	kha-sbyor-gyi	rgyud
,	sDe-dge	NGB,	Vol.
4,	pp.	119a-b).	As	before,	it	is	written	in	the	ḍākiṇ
ῑ
	script	of	Oḍḍiyāna.	The	main
verses	are	preceded	by	OṂ	ĀḤ	HŪṂ	and	concluded	by	the	ten	syllables	of
bodily	energy	(SASĀ	ṚṜ	ḶḸ	IĪ	MAMĀ),	and	those	indicative	of	buddha-body
(RARĀ).	See	Namkhai	Norbu,	
The	Dzogchen	Ritual	Practices
,	pp.	132-6.

These	twenty-five	mantras	which	follow	are	again	rendered	in	the	ḍākiṇ

The	Delhi	reprint	(p.	225)	comments	that	each	of	these	preceding	mantras
encapsulates	the	natural	sound	of	reality	(
chos-nyid	rang-sgra
)	and	is	capable	of
conferring	liberation.	As	such,	these	mantras	are	contrasted	with	the
vidyāmantra
	
and	
dhāraṇ

mantra

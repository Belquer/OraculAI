the	mouth	of	the	accomplished	masters	come	these	words:
‘O,	[you],	with	your	mind	far	away,	thinking	that	death	will	not	come,
Entranced	by	the	pointless	activities	of	this	life,
If	you	were	to	return	empty-handed	now,	would	not	your	[life’s]	purpose	have
been	[utterly]	confused?
Recognise	 what	 it	 is	 that	 you	 truly	 need!	 It	 is	 a	 sacred	 teaching	 [for
liberation]!
So,	should	you	not	practise	this	divine	[sacred]	teaching,	beginning	from	this
very	moment?’
	
And	it	is	also	said,
‘If	I	choose	not	to	take	the	oral	teachings	of	the	spiritual	teacher	to	heart,
Am	I	not	the	deceiver	of	myself?’
	
This	completes	the	
Root	Verses	of	the	Six	Intermediate	States

[THE	IMPORTANCE	OF	THE	INTRODUCTION	TO
AWARENESS]

EMAHO!
Though	the	single	[nature	of]	mind,	which	completely	pervades	both	cyclic
existence	and	nirvāṇa,
Has	been	naturally	present	from	the	beginning,	you	have	not	recognised	it.
Even	though	its	radiance	and	awareness	have	never	been	interrupted,
You	have	not	yet	encountered	its	true	face.
Even	though	it	arises	unimpededly	in	every	facet	[of	existence],
You	have	not	as	yet	recognised	[this	single	nature	of	mind].
In	order	that	this	[single]	nature	might	be	recognised	by	you,
The	Conquerors	of	the	three	times	have	taught	an	inconceivably	[vast	number
of	practices],
Including	the	eighty-four	thousand	aspects	of	the	[sacred]	teachings.
Yet,	[despite	this	diversity],	not	even	one	of	these	[teachings]	has	been	given
by	the	Conquerors,
Outside	the	context	of	an	understanding	of	this	nature!
3
[And	even]	though	there	are	inestimable	volumes	of	sacred	writings,	equally
vast	as	the	limits	of	space,
Actually,	[these	teachings	can	be	succinctly	expressed	in]	a	few	words,
4
which	are	the	introduction	to	awareness.
	
Here	[is]	the	direct	[face	to	face]	introduction
To	the	enlightened	intention	of	the	Conquerors.
Here	is	the	method	for	entering	[into	actual	reality],
[In	this	very	moment],	without	reference	to	past	or	future	[events].
[THE	ACTUAL	INTRODUCTION	TO	AWARENESS]
KYE	HO!
O	fortunate	children,	listen	to	these	words!
The	term	‘mind’	is	commonplace	and	widely	used,
Yet	there	are	those	who	do	not	understand	[its	meaning],
Those	who	falsely	understand	it,	those	who	partially	understand	it,
And	those	who	have	not	quite	understood	its	genuine	reality.
Thus	there	has	arisen	an	inconceivably	vast	number	of	assertions	[as	to	the
nature	of	mind],

Posited	by	[the	various]	philosophical	systems.
5
	
Further,	since	ordinary	persons	do	not	understand	[the	meaning	of	the	term
‘mind’],
And	do	not	intuitively	recognise	its	nature,
They	continue	to	roam	through	the	six	classes	of	sentient	[rebirth]	within	the
three	world-

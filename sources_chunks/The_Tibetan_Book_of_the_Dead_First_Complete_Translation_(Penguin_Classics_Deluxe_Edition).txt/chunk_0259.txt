penetrative	 insight
	 may	 be	 present	 in	 perfect	 union.	 In	 the	
sūtras
	 and
abhidharma
	 literature	 of	 the	
Lesser	 Vehicle
,	 four	 states	 of	 meditative
concentration	are	identified	as	being	conducive	to	birth	in	the	seventeen	levels	of
the	
form	realm
.	These	are	characterised,	in	their	proper	order,	by	a	temporary
sojourn	from:	1)	physical	sensations	of	pain;	2)	mental	unhappiness;	3)	mental
excitements	related	to	pleasure;	and	4)	mundane	experiences	of	joy	as	a	whole.
In	the	context	of	the	
Greater	Vehicle
,	meditative	concentration	is	the	fifth	of	the
six	perfections
	(Skt.	
ṣaṭpāramitā
).
	
Meditative	Equipoise
	
mnyam-par	bzhag-pa
,	Skt.	
samāhita
Meditative	 equipoise	 refers	 to	 a	 one-pointed	 placement	 of	 the	 mind	 on	 a
meditation	 object	 or	 a	 theme,	 such	 as	 the	
selflessness
	 of	 the	 individual
personality	(Skt.	
pudgalanairātmya
	
)	and	the	
selflessness
	of	phenomena	(Skt.
dharmanairātmya
),	 which	 invariably	 occurs	 in	 the	 context	 of	 prolonged
meditative	 stability
(Skt.	
samādhi
).	 It	 is	 contrasted	 with	 periods	 of	 post-
meditation	(Skt.	
pṛṣtalabdha
,	Tib.	
rjes-thob
)	during	which	the	meditator	arises
from	meditative	equipoise,	and	engages	with	his	or	her	environment.
	
Meditative	Stability
	
ting-nge-’dzin
,	Skt.	
samādhi
The	Sanskrit	term	
samādhi
	literally	means	‘union’	or	‘combination’,	and	its
Tibetan	equivalent	
ting-nge-’dzin
	means	‘adhering	to	that	which	is	profound	and
definitive’.	 However,	 the	 term	 has	 several	 different	 meanings	 in	 different
contexts.	For	example,	in	
abhidharma
	texts	it	sometimes	refers	to	a	mental
factor	 that	 is	 part	 of	 a	 group	 of	 mental	 factors	 present	 in	 every	 veridical
cognition,	whereas	in	the	context	of	meditation,	it	can	be	synonymous	with
Meditative	 concentration
.	 In	 many	 instances,	
samādhi
	 refers	 to	 specific

meditative	 states	 such	 as	 diamond-like	 meditation,	 lion’s	 majestic	 pose
meditation	and	others	enumerated	in	the	
sūtras
	and	
tantras
	of	the	
Greater
Vehicle
.	 More	 specifically,	 in	 the	
Mahāyoga	 tantras
,	 the	 term	 meditative
stability	refers	to	the	three	phases	of	the	
generation
	and	
perfection	stages
	of
meditation.	These	are:	the	
leditative	stability	of	reality
	(
de-bzhin	nyid-kyi	ting-
nge-’dzin
),	the	
meditative	stability	which	illuminates	all	that	appears
	(
kun-tu
snang-ba’i	ting-nge-’dzin
),	and	the	
meditative	stability	of	the	causal	basis
(
rgyu’i	 ting-nge-’dzin
),	 which	 respectively	 and	 sequentially	 focus	 on	 great
emptiness
,	great	
compassion
	and	the	
seals
	of	the	
meditational	deities
.	In	the
Unsurpassed
	
Yogatantras
,	 somewhat	 different	 terminology	 is	 used	 in	 the
contexts	of	the	
generation	stage
	and	the	
perfection	stage
.	In	the	generation
stage,	the	practice	of	the	
means	of	attainment
	takes	place	within	the	framework
of	(i)	the	initial	meditative	stability	(
dang-po	sbyor-ba’i	ting-nge-’dzin
),	(ii)	the
meditative	stability	of	the	victorious	rite	of	the	
maṇḍala
	(
dkyil-’khor	rgyal-chog-
gi	ting-nge-’dzin
),	and	(iii)	the	meditative	stability	of	the	victorious	rite	of
enlightened	activity	(
las	rgyal-chog-gi	ting-nge’dzin
	
).	In	the	context	of	the
perfection	stage
,	however,	these	same	terms	refer	to	an	advanced	level	of
realisation.
	
Mental	Body
	
yid-lus
,	Skt.	
manokāya
The	non-corporeal	body	assumed	during	the	
intermediate	state	of	rebirth
,
which	is	said	to	have	an	initial	similitude	to	the	physical	body	of	the	previous
life.	See	Chapter	11.

Merit
	
bsod-nams
,	 Skt.	
puṇya
	
Merit	 refers	 to	 the	 wholesome	 tendencies
imprinted	in	the	mind	as	a	result	of	positive	and	skilful	thoughts,	words,	and
actions	that	ripen	in	the	experience	of	happiness	and	well-being.	According	to
the	
Greater	Vehicle
,	it	is	important	to	dedicate	the	merit	of	one’s	wholesome
actions	to	the	benefit	of	all	
sentient	beings
,	ensuring	that	others	also	experience
the	results	of	the	positive

Skilful	Means
	
thabs
,	Skt.	
upāya
The	concept	of	skilful	means	is	central	to	the	understanding	of	the	
Buddha
’s
enlightened	deeds,	including	his	teaching	of	the	many	scriptures.	From	a	very
early	 stage,	 Buddhism	 developed	 a	 hermeneutics	 of	 reading	 many	 of	 the

scriptures	attributed	to	the	
Buddha
	from	the	perspective	of	skilful	means,	that	is
to	say	from	the	perspective	that	the	truths	revealed	in	a	specific	teaching	may	be
contingent	on	the	needs,	interests	and	mental	dispositions	of	specific	types	of
individuals.	This	idea	of	skilful	means,	especially	in	the	context	of	acting	for	the
welfare	of	others,	such	as	through	the	giving	of	teachings,	was	applied	also	in
relation	to	the	altruistic	deeds	of	the	
bodhisattvas
.	According	to	the	
Greater
Vehicle
,	training	in	skilful	means	(Skt.	
upāyakauśalya
,	Tib
.	thabs-la	mkhas-pa
)
refers	to	the	first	five	of	the	
six	perfections
:	generosity,	discipline,	patience,
perseverance,	 and	
meditative	 concentration
	
;	 when	 integrated	 with
discriminative	 awareness
,	 the	 sixth	 perfection,	 they	 form	 a	 union	 of
discriminatve	 awareness
	 and	 means	 (Skt.	
prajñopāya
).	 The	 perfection	 of
skilful	means	is	also	separately	enumerated	among	the	ten	perfections,	where	it
indicates	 the	 inestimable	 result	 acquired	 by	 dedicating	 the	
merit
	 of	 one’s
virtuous	deeds,	however	small,	for	the	benefit	of	all	sentient	beings	in	general
and	for	the	sake	of	great	unsurpassed	
enlightenment
	in	particular.	In	the	
tantras
,
the	technical	term	‘path	of	skilful	means’	(
thabs-lam
)	refers	to	the	practices	in
which	 the	 internal	
sexual	 yoga
	 (
sbyor-ba
)	 of	 the	
energy	 channels
,	
vital
energies
	and	
seminal	points
	is	refined	within	the	
subtle	body
.	Also,	the	three
inner	classes	of
	
tantra
	according	to	the	
Nyingma
	school	are	sometimes	referred
to	as	the	‘vehicles	of	overpowering	means’	(
thabs	dbang-bsgyur-ba’i	theg-pa-
rnams
),	in	the	sense	that	they	carry	on	the	path	all	the	
dissonant	mental	states
which	are	renounced	in	the	lower	paths.

According	to	Sino-Tibetan	elemental	divination,	the	spirit	lords	of	the	soil	are	a
class	of	geomantic	forces	whose	position	rotates	-	in	some	cases	according	to	the
years	of	the	sexagenary	calendar,	and	in	others	according	to	the	months	of	the

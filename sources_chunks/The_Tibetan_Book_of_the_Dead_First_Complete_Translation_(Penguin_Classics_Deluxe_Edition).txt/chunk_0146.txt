king	into	the	ocean	of	suffering,
for	 a	 very	 long	 time.	 Therefore,	 now,	 from	 the	 very	 beginning,	 I	 must	 not
generate	attachment	or	aversion.	Oh	dear,	Oh	dear!	As	of	now,	I	shall	never
again	be	motivated	by	attachment	or	aversion.’	By	concentrating	intently	on	this

thought,	as	it	is	said	in	the	tantras,	the	womb	entrances	will	be	obstructed	by	this
[singular	 intent]	 alone.	 O,	 Child	 of	 Buddha	 Nature,	 do	 not	 be	 distracted!
Concentrate	your	mind	on	this	thought,	with	a	one-pointed	intention.
	
Yet	if,	even	having	done	this,	the	womb	entrances	are	still	not	obstructed	and
[the	deceased]	draws	ever	nearer	to	entering	a	womb,	then	the	womb	entrances
should	be	obstructed	by	giving	the	oral	instruction	on	the	unreal	and	illusion-like
nature	[of	all	phenomena].
31
	
[O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature],	meditate	in	the	following	way!	‘Alas!	The	father
and	the	mother	[in	sexual	union],	the	rain,	the	blackness,	the	hurricane,	the
thunderous	sound,	the	fearful	and	terrifying	experiences,	the	nature	of	these	and
of	all	phenomena	is	illusion-like.	In	whatever	form	[phenomena]	arise,	they	are
not	real.	All	substantial	things	are	unreal	and	false,	like	a	mirage.	They	are	not
permanent.	They	are	not	changeless.	So	what	is	the	purpose	of	my	attachment
[to	these	perceptions]?	What	is	the	purpose	of	my	awe	and	terror?	That	which	is
non-existent,	 I	 am	 seeing	 as	 existent!	 [In	 reality],	 all	 these	 things	 [that	 I
perceive]	are	the	perceptions	of	my	own	mind.	Yet,	the	essential	nature	of	mind	is
primordially	non-existent,	like	an	illusion.	So	how	is	it	possible	for	things	to	exist
externally,	in	their	own	right?	Since	I	have	not	understood	this	before,	I	have
[always]	regarded	the	non-existent	as	existent.	I	have	regarded	the	unreal	as
real.	I	have	regarded	illusions	as	truth.	This	is	why	I	have	roamed	in	cyclic
existence	for	such	a	long	time.	Now,	yet	again,	if	I	do	not	realise	that	all	these
[phenomena]	 are	 illusions,	 I	 will	 continue	 to	 roam	 in	 cyclic	 existence,
interminably,	and	without	doubt,	I	will	drown	in	a	swamp	of	every	manner	of
suffering.	 Now,	 [I	 must	 realise	 that]	 all	 these	 [phenomena]	 are	 completely
devoid	of	substantial	existence,	even	for	a	single	instant.	[In	reality],	they	are
like	a	dream,	like	an	illusion,	like	an	echo,	like	a	celestial	city,	like	a	mirage,	like
a	reflection,	like	an	optical	illusion,	like	the	moon	[reflected]	in	water.	It	is
absolutely	certain	that	these	[phenomena]	are	not	truly	real,	but	that	they	are
false.	Through	this	singular	resolve,	I	will	blow	apart	my	apprehension	of	their
true	existence.	Through	utter	confidence	in	this	[meditation],	my	apprehension
of	self-existence	will	be	reversed.’	By	knowing	from	the	depths	of	your	heart	that
all	 these	 [phenomena]	 are	 unreal,	 the	 womb	 entrances	 will	 certainly	 be
obstructed.
	

However,	 if,	 despite	 this	 [teaching]	 being	 given,	 the	 apprehension	 of	 true
existence	is	not	shattered,	and	the	womb	entrances	are	therefore	not	obstructed
and	[the	deceased]	draws	ever	nearer	to	entering	a	womb,	then	there	is	a	[final]
profound	oral	instruction:
	
O,	 Child	 of	 Buddha	 Nature,	 if,	 even	 after	 having	 engaged	 in	 the	 above
[meditation],	the	womb	entrances	have	still	not	been	obstructed,	now,	according
to	the	fifth	[profound	oral	instruction],	you	must	obstruct	the	womb	entrances	by
meditating	on	inner	radiance.
32
	
The	method	of	meditation	is	as	follows:	‘Alas!
All	[seemingly]	substantial	phenomena	are	[expressions	of]	my	own	mind.	Yet,
[in	reality],	this	mind	is	of	the	nature	of	emptiness,	it	is	beyond	creation	and
beyond	cessation.’	By	focusing	your	thought	in	this	way,	your	mind	should
[naturally]	return	to	an	uncontrived	and	stainless	state.	Let	the	mind	rest	in	this,
its	natural	state,	directly	in	itself,	in	the	same	way,	for	example,	as	water	is
poured	into	water.	Let	[the	mind]	rest	in	its	natural	flow,	clear,	unconstricted,
uncontrived	and	relaxed.

[By	following	this	method]	
you	can	be	sure	t

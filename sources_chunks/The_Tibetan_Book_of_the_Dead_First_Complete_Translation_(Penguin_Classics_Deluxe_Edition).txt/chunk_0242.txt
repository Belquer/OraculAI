Four	Times
	
dus-bzhi
Past,	present,	future,	and	indefinite	time.	In	some	contexts	the	four	times	refer	to
different	phases	of	conceptual	thought,	in	which	case	they	are	enumerated	as
past	thoughts,	present	thoughts,	future	thoughts	and	indeterminate	thoughts	(
so-
sor	rtog-pa
).
	
Fundamental	Ignorance
	
ma-rig-pa
,	Skt.	
avidyā
The	most	fundamental	misapprehension	of	the	nature	of	
actual	reality
,	which	is
the	source	of	all	
dissonant	mental	states
	and	the	
twelve	links	of	dependent
origination
.	Divergent	views	exist	among	Buddhist	thinkers	about	the	specific
character	and	nature	of	fundamental	ignorance.	For	example,	the	fourth-century
master	
Asaṅga
	
conceives	this	ignorance	to	be	a	state	of	unknowing,	ignorant	of
the	 actual	 nature	 of	
reality
.	 In	 contrast,	 for	 masters	 like	
Nāgārjuna
	 and
especially	
Dharmak
ῑ
rti
,	it	is	an	active	state	of	mis-knowing,	
i.e.
	it	understands
the	existence	of	one’s	own	self	and	the	world	in	a	fundamentally	distorted
manner.	 In	 the	 classical	 Indian	 Buddhist	 texts,	 two	 principal	 forms	 of
fundamental	ignorance	are	identified	-	(i)	ignorance	pertaining	to	the	actual
nature	of	
reality
	and	(ii)	ignorance	pertaining	to	the	law	of	
cause	and	effect
.
The	
Nyingma
	master	
Dudjom	Rinpoche
	explains	the	evolution	of	
bewilderment
from	fundamental	ignorance	in	three	phases:	first,	the	fundamental	ignorance	of
self-identity
	(
bdag-nyid	 gcig-pu’i	 ma-rig-pa
)	 is	 not	 recognised	 to	 be	 false;
second,	 the	
coemergent	 ignorance
	 (
lhan-skyes	 ma-rig-pa
)	 ensures	 that	 the
consciousness	of	
self-identity
	and	non-recognition	of	
actual	reality
	coincide;
and,	third,	the	fundamental	ignorance	of	the	imaginary	(
kun-btags	ma-rig-pa
)
generates	
bewilderment
,	through	which	one’s	own	bewildering	perceptions	are
externally	discerned	in	terms	of	the	subject-object	dichotomy,	giving	rise	to	all
the	
sufferings
	
of	
cyclic	existence
.
	
Garuda
	
khyung
A	mythical	bird	normally	depicted	with	an	owl-like	sharp	beak,	often	holding	a
snake,	and	with	large	and	powerful	wings.	References	to	this	bird	can	be	also
found	in	Hindu	literature	where	it	is	often	mentioned	as	the	flying	mount	of
powerful	mundane	
gods
	(
deva
).	In	Buddhism,	the	symbolism	of	the	
garuḍa
	is
generally	associated	with	
pristine	cognition
	(it	is	said	that	the	
garuḍa
	can	fly	as
soon	as	it	is	hatched)	and	with	the	consuming	of	
dissonant	mental	states
	(the
holding	of	a	snake	in	its	beak).	In	a	Buddhist	context,	the	
garuḍa
	is	also

associated	 with	
Vajrapāṇi
	
and	 certain	 wrathful	 forms	 of	
Padmasambhava
through	its	power	to	subdue	snakes,	
serpentine	water	spirits
,	and	subterranean
creatures,	 and,	 according	 to	 the	
Nyingma
	
school,	 the	
garuḍa
	 is	 sometimes
revered	 as	 a	 guardian	 of	
treasures
	(
gter-bdag
)	 or	 even	 as	 a	 repository	 of
treasures
	(
gter-kha
).
	
Gelug
	
dge-lugs
One	of	the	four	main	traditions	or	schools	of	Tibetan	Buddhism.	Founded	by	the
great	fourteenth-century	philosopher	
Tsongkhapa
	and	his	foremost	students,	it
quickly	established	itself	as	a	dominant	tradition	of	Tibetan	Buddhism	with	its
monasteries	extending	from	the	far	west	of	Tibet	to	
Chamdo
,	
Dartsedo
,	and
Amdo
	
in	 the	 east.	 Following	 the	 Third	
Dalai	Lama
’s	 visit	 to	 Mongolia,	 it
became	the	state	religion	in	Mongolia	and	the	Buriat	regions	of	the	Soviet
Union,	and	during	the	seventeenth	century	its	hierarchy	became	the	dominant
political	 force	 in	 Central	 Tibet	 when	 the	 Fifth	
Dalai	 Lama
	 assumed	 both
spiritual	and	temporal	power	with	the	assistance	of	Mongol	armies.	‘Gelug’
literally	 means	 the	 tradition	 of	 the	 virtuous	 path	 and	 is	 named	 after	 the
monastery	called	
Geden
	or	
Ganden
,	founded	by	
Tsongkhapa
	in	1409.

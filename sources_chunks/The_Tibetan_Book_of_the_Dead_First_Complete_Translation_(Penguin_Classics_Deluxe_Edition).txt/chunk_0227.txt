Calm	Abiding

,	Skt.	
śamatha
Calm	abiding	is	a	meditative	technique	common	to	the	entire	Buddhist	tradition,
characterised	by	a	stabilisation	of	attention	on	an	internal	object	of	observation
conjoined	with	the	calming	of	external	distractions	to	the	mind.	Calm	abiding	is
an	essential	basis	for	training	one’s	mind	in	the	generation	of	
penetratrative
insight
	
(
vipaśyana
),	a	true	analytical	insight	into	the	more	profound	aspects	of	a
chosen	object,	such	as	its	
emptiness
	or	ultimate	nature.

hetuphala
In	the	context	of	Buddhist	philosophy	the	term	refers	to	the	natural	law	that
exists	between	a	cause	and	its	effect.	Some	of	the	principal	features	of	the	law
are:	1)	nothing	evolves	uncaused;	2)	any	entity	which	itself	lacks	a	process	of
change	cannot	cause	any	other	event;	and	3)	only	causes	which	possess	natures

that	accord	with	specific	effects	can	lead	to	those	effects.	The	term	‘cause	and
effect’	is	often	used	to	translate	the	Sanskrit	word	
karma
,	which	literally	means
‘action’.	See

Channel	Branch

According	to	the	
tantras
	and	related	medical	traditions,	there	are	five	
energy
centres
	
located	along	the	
central	channel
	of	the	body	at	the	focal	points	of	the
crown,	throat,	heart,	navel	and	genitalia.	A	specific	number	of	channel	branches
(
rtsa-‘dab
)	emerges	from	each	of	these	energy	centres,	and	these	in	turn	conduct
vital	energy
	
throughout	the	body	through	a	network	of	72,000	minor	channels.

Chiliocosm

According	to	traditional	Indian	Buddhist	cosmology,	the	world	of	the

surrounding	
Mount
	
Sumeru
	when	multiplied	one	thousand	times
forms	a	chiliocosm	of	parallel	worlds	(

).	The	chiliocosm	when
multiplied	one	thousand	times	forms	a	larger	
dichiliocosm
	(
stong	gnyis-pa
),
which	 in	 turn	 when	 multiplied	 one	 thousand	 times	 forms	 an	 even	 larger
trichiliocosm	(
stong	gsum-pa
).	This	evolution	of	expanding	worlds	continues	to
enlarge	incrementally	until	the	inconceivably	vast	number	of	multiple	worlds	is
reached,	in	which	a	single	supreme	
Buddha-body	of	Emanation
	is	said	to
function	simultaneously.

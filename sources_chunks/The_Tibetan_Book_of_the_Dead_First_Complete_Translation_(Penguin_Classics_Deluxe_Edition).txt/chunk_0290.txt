the	six	resultant	vehicles	of	the

speech
	and	
mind
	are	fully	realised	and
manifested	 when	 the	
continuum	 of	 the	 ground
	 is	 transformed	 into	 the
continuum	of	the	result
	by	means	of	the	
continuum	of	the	path
.	See	under

Secret
	
Mantras
	 (Skt.
Guhyamantrayāna

Vinaya
	
’dul-ba
The	Sanskrit	term	
vinaya
,	literally	meaning	‘discipline’,	refers	to	the	monastic
discipline	maintained	by	members	of	the	Buddhist	community,	including	the
ethical	codes	which	regulate	the	life	of	fully	ordained	monks	and	nuns,	as	well
as	probationary	nuns,	novice	monks	and	nuns,	and	male	and	female	laity.	The
collection	of	
Śākyamuni	Buddha
’s	discourses	which	elucidate	and	define	the
principles	of	these	ethical	codes	(including	the	administrative	guidelines	for
running	a	monastery)	is	known	as	the	
vinayapiṭaka
,	which	is	one	of	the	three
primary	collections	of	discourses	comprising	the	Buddhist	canon	(Skt.	
tripiṭaka
).
Based	on	different	interpretations	relating	to	the	subtler	points	of	the	
Buddha
’s
discourses	on	
vinaya
,	there	emerged,	in	ancient	India,	several	distinct	schools,
including	the	
Sthaviravāda
,	
Sarvāstivāda
,	
Mahāsaṅghika
	and	
Sammit
ῑ
ya
.	The
vinaya
	 tradition	 which	 became	 predominant	 in	 Tibet	 is	 that	 of	 the
Sarvāstivādins

Virtuous	Action
	
dge-ba
,	Skt.	
kuśala
Both	 virtue	 and	 its	 opposite,	 non-virtue	 (Skt.	
akuśala
,	 Tib.	
mi-dge-ba
)	 are
defined	in	terms	of	both	motivation	and	the	consequences	of	the	action.	In	order
for	an	action	to	be	defined	as	either	virtuous	or	non-virtuous,	there	are	certain
prerequisite	features	which	must	be	present.	These	are:	motivation,	the	actual

execution	of	the	
act,	and	the	conclusion.	An	act	is	non-virtuous	if	it	is:	1)
motivated	by	negative	intentions;	2)	committed	by	the	agent	in	a	sane	mind	and
with	full	knowledge;	and	3)	the	person	derives	a	sense	of	satisfaction	from
having	accomplished	the	act.	Such	actions	can	be	physical,	verbal,	or	mental.
Broadly	speaking,	non-virtuous	actions	are	categorised	into	the	following	ten
types:	killing,	stealing,	and	sexual	misconduct	(which	are	the	three	physical
actions);	lying,	divisive	speech,	harsh	speech,	and	meaningless	gossip	(which	are
the	four	verbal	actions);	and	covetousness,	harmful	intent,	and	distorted	views
(which	are	the	three	mental	actions).	An	act	is	considered	virtuous	if	it	either
passively	 refrains	 from	 the	 ten	 recognised	 types	 of	 non-virtuous	 action,	 or
actively	engages	in	acts	for	the	sake	of	others	with	an	altruistic	motivation.
	
Visionary	Appearances
	
snang-ba
According	to	the	terminology	of	the	
Great	Perfection
,	there	are	four	successive
visionary	 appearances	 experienced	 through	 the	 practice	 of	
All-surpassing
Realisation
	
(
thod-rgal
).	 These	 are:	 the	 visionary	 appearance	 of	 the	 direct
perception	 of	
reality
	 (
chos-nyid	 mngon-sum-gyi	 snang-ba
),	 the	 visionary
appearance	 of	 increasing	 contemplative	 experience	 (
nyams	 gong-’phel-ba’i
snang-ba
),	the	visionary	appearance	of	reaching	the	limit	of	
awareness
	(
rig-pa
tshad-phebs-kyi	snang-ba
),	and	the	visionary	appearance	of	the	cessation	of
clinging	to	reality	(
chos-nyid-du	’dzin-pa	zad-pa’i	snang-ba
).

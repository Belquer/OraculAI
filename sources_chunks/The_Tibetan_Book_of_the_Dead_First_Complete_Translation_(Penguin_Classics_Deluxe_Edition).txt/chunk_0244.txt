Great	Bliss
	
bde-chen
,	Skt.	
mahāsukha
In	the	context	of	
Unsurpassed
	
Yogatantra
,	‘great	bliss’	refers	to	the	blissful
states	experienced	when	the	meditator	enters	into	union	with	a	partner	(either	in
visualisation	at	the	beginner’s	level	or	in	actuality	at	an	advanced	stage).	In	both
cases,	the	experiences,	to	be	valid,	have	to	arise	as	a	result	of	the	dissolution	of
mental	 conceptuality	 and	 the	 vital	 energies	 which	 support	 these	 conceptual
states.	Such	a	blissful	state	of	
mind
,	when	generated	within	a	direct	experience
of	
emptiness
,	free	from	attachment,	becomes	what	is	known	as	the	union	of
bliss	and	
emptiness
.
	
Great	Perfection
	
rdzogs-pa	chen-po

Great	Perfection	is	a	synonym	for	
Atiyoga
,	the	highest	of	the	
nine	vehicles
according	to	the	
Nyingma
	tradition.	
Atiyoga
	is	known	as	the	Great	Perfection
because	 both	 the	
generation
	 and	
perfection	 stages
	 of	
meditation
	 are
effortlessly	present.	‘Perfection’	
(
rdzogs
)	implies	that	the	enlightened	attributes
of	the	
Three	Buddha-bodies
	are	effortlessly	perfected	in	the	stabilisation	of	the
meditator’s	
instrinsic	awareness
	(
rang-rig
	
).	Here	the	
Buddha-body	of	Reality
(
dharmakāya
)	 is	 the	
essence
	 or	
emptiness
	
(
ngo-bo	 stong-pa
)	 of	
intrinsic
awareness
;	 the	
Buddha-body	 of	 Perfect	 Resource
	
(
sambhogakāya
)	 is	 its
natural	expression
	and	radiance	(
rang-bzhin	gsal-ba
);	and	the	
Buddha-body	of
Emanation
	(
nirmāṇakāya
)	is	its	all-pervasive	unimpeded	compassionate	energy
(
ma-’gags	thugs-rje
)	expressed	in	physical	form.	‘Great’	(
chen
)	implies	that	this
perfection	is	the	underlying	nature	of	all	things.	The	
tantra
	texts	and	instructions
of	
Atiyoga
,	contained	in	the	
Collected	Tantras	of	the	Nyingmapa
,	are	divided
into	three	classes:	the	Mental	Class	(
sems-sde
),	which	emphasises	the	radiance
(
gsal-ba’i	cha
)	of	the	nature	of	mind	(
sems-nyid
);	the	Spatial	Class	(
klongsde
	
)
which	 emphasises	 the	
emptiness
	 (
stong-pa’i	 cha
)	 of	
reality’s	 expanse
(
dharmadhātu
	
);	and	the	
Esoteric	Instructional	Class
	(
man-ngag-gi	sde
),	in
which	these	aspects	are	given	equal	emphasis	and	in	which	the	meditative
techniques	of	
Cutting	through	Resistance
	(
khregs-chod
)	and	
All-surpassing
Realisation
	(
thod-rgal
)	lead	respectively	to	the	realisation	of	the	
Buddha-body
of	Reality
	and	the	
Buddha-body	of	Form
.
	
Great	Seal
	
phyag-rgya	chen-po
,	Skt.	
mahāmudrā
According	to	the	tradition	of	the	
sūtras
,	the	expression	‘Great	Seal’	refers	to	the
comprehension	of	
emptiness
	as	the	all-encompassing	ultimate	nature	of	
reality
.

Emptiness
	is	called	the	great	seal,	for	nothing	extraneous	to	it	exists,	and	all
phenomena,	both	physical	and	mental,	are	in	their	ultimate	natures	empty	of
inherent	existence
.	According	to	the	tradition	of	the	
tantras
	in	general,	the
practice	of	the	Great	Seal	is	considered	in	terms	of	ground,	path	and	result.	As	a
‘path’,	 it	 comprises	 a	 sequence	 of	 systematic	 advanced	
meditations
	 on
emptiness
	and	pure	appearance,	integrating	the	techniques	of	
calm	abiding
	and
penetrative	insight
,	which	focuses	on	the	nature	of	the	meditator’s	own	
mind
.
This	type	of	
meditation
	
is	popular	in	both	the	
Kagyu
	and	
Gelug
	schools	of
Tibetan	Buddhism.	As	a	‘result’,	the	expression	‘Great	Seal’	refers	to	the	state	of
buddhahood
,	 the	 conclusive	 result	 or	 supreme	 spiritual	
accomplishment
.
According	to	the	
Nyingma
	school,	within	the	context	of	
Mahāyoga
	in	particular,
the	term	refers	to	the	great	seal	of	
buddha-body
	
which	secures	the	
ground-of-
all	 consciousness
	 (
ālayavijñāna
)	 as	 the	 mirror-like	
pristinne	 cognition
.	 A
distinction	is	also	drawn	between	the	supreme	accomplishment	of	the	Great	Seal
(
phyag-rgya	chen-po	mchog-gi	dngos-grub
),	which	is	to	be	attained	in	the	course
of	the

ns	 with	 high	 realisation	 will
[successfully]	effect	the	transference	of	consciousness	at	the	moment	of	death,
and,	being	spared	the	necessity	of	having	to	wander	through	the	intermediate
states,	will	attain	liberation	in	an	ascending	and	core-penetrating	manner.	Certain
others,	below	these	[yogins	in	ability],	who	have	achieved	[direct]	meditative
experience,	will	recognise	the	inner	radiance	of	reality,	at	the	culmination	of	the
intermediate	state	of	the	time	of	death,	[and	will,	similarly,	attain	buddhahood]	in
an	ascending	and	core-penetrating	manner.	Others,	below	these,	in	accord	with
their	inheritance	of	past	actions	and	their	particular	level	of	ability,	
will	attain
liberation	at	one	[moment]	or	at	another,	during	the	[respective]	weeks	[which
follow	the	moment	of	death],	as	the	visions	of	the	Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities
gradually	arise	in	the	intermediate	state	of	reality.	Since	there	is	a	succession	of
dangerous	 passageways,	 recognition	 will	 occur	 at	 an	 appropriate	 juncture
[during	the	intermediate	state	of	reality]	and	liberation	will	follow.
However,	those	who	have	a	very	weak	inheritance	of	[positive]	past	actions,
those	 who	 are	 greatly	 clouded	 by	 negative	 obscuration	 and	 those	 who	 are
burdened	 by	 the	 most	 non-virtuous	 past	 actions,	 will	 be	 obliged	 to	 roam

downwards	into	the	intermediate	state	of	rebirth.	Here,	as	before,	since	there	are
different	levels	of	introduction,	like	the	rungs	of	a	ladder,	recognition	will	occur,
if	not	at	one	stage,	then	at	another;	and	thereby	liberation	will	follow.
But	if	those,	just	mentioned,	who	have	a	weak	inheritance	of	[positive]	past
actions,	do	not	achieve	recognition	and	are	accordingly	overcome	by	fear	and
terror,	 then,	 there	 is	 a	 graded	 series	 of	 different	 forms	 of	 instruction	 [for
obstructing,	and]	for	choosing,	the	womb	entrance.	Thus,	if	recognition	does	not
occur	 in	 the	 course	 of	 one	 such	 teaching,	 then,	 these	 individuals	 will	 be
introduced	to	yet	another	[instruction]	and	upon	understanding	the	[appropriate]
visualisation	technique	they	will	achieve	the	inestimable	bounty	of	the	higher
existences.	Even	if	one	is,	like	a	beast,	the	lowest	of	the	low,	through	the
munificence	of	taking	refuge,	one	will	avoid	birth	in	inferior	existences	and
assume	a	precious	human	body,	[blessed]	with	the	benefits	of	freedom	and
favourable	opportunities.	Then,	in	the	life	to	come,	one	will	meet	a	spiritual
teacher	 or	 spiritual	 friend,	 and	 one	 will	 receive	 the	 teachings,	 and	 thereby
liberation	will	follow.
This	[sacred]	teaching,	when	encountered	in	the	intermediate	state	of	rebirth,
is	 an	 [oral]	 instruction	 that	 connects	 [the	 deceased]	 with	 their	 residual
inheritance	of	virtuous	past	actions.	This	is	why	it	[is	said	to]	resemble	a
connecting	tube	which	[re-establishes	continuity]	when	inserted	into	a	broken
water	channel.	Therefore,	[based	on	the	veracity	of	this	method],	it	is	impossible
not	to	be	liberated	upon	hearing	this	teaching,	even	for	those	of	the	greatest
negativity.	 This	 is	 because,	 during	 the	 intermediate	 states,	 both	 the
compassionate	invitation	of	all	the	[Peaceful	and	Wrathful]	Conquerors	and	the
invitation	of	the	manifestations	of	the	malevolent	and	obstacle-causing	forces
arise	simultaneously.	As	this	occurs,	merely	by	hearing	this	[sacred]	teaching,
the	mode	of	
perception	[of	the	deceased]	is	transformed	and	liberation	is	thereby
attained.
Further,	this	transformation	is	easy	to	effect	because	[the	deceased]	now
possesses	a	[subtle]	mental	body	and	not	a	body	of	flesh	and	blood;	the	deceased
continues	to	see	and	hear,	with	a	subtle	supernormal	cognitive	ability	based	on
the	 potency	 of	 past	 actions,	 however	 far	 he	 or	 she	 has	 wandered	 into	 the
intermediate	states.	[Thus],	by	sustaining	mindfulness	[of	the	teaching],	the
deceased	is	capable	of	transforming	his	or	her	perception	in	an	instant.	This	is
why	[the	reminder	of	the	teaching]	is	extremely	beneficial.	Its	impact

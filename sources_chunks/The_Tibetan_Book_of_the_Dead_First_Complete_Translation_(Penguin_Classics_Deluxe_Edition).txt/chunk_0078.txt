ecapitated	and	having	one’s	head	carried	off	by
another,
Or	of	being	surrounded	by	crows,	anguished	spirits,	or	villains,
Or	of	being	willingly	led	away,	or	leaving	[home]	in	a	bridal	procession,
Of	being	naked,	with	one’s	hair	cut	off	and	beard	shaved,
Of	constantly	associating	with	friends	who	have	died,
Of	being	dragged	along	by	a	crowd	of	dead	people,
Of	jumping	into	water,	sinking	into	mud,	or	being	swallowed	by	fish,
Of	entering	a	womb	and	falling	asleep,
Of	being	overcome	in	a	battle,	in	which	the	other	side	is	victorious,
Of	wearing	red	clothing,	and	being	adorned	with	red	garlands,
Of	repeatedly	picking	red	flowers,
Of	climbing	a	mountain	of	red	shellac,
Of	having	one’s	head	wrapped	in	a	red	silk	turban,
Of	twigs	growing	on	the	crown	of	your	head,	and	birds	nesting	there,
Of	falling	asleep	repeatedly	in	a	terrifying	charnel	ground,
Of	being	old,	and	carrying	a	heavy	burden,
Of	the	sun	and	moon	falling	to	the	plains,	leaving	one	shrouded	in	darkness,
Of	jumping	headlong	into	a	pit,
Of	dancing	together	with	a	host	of	ogres,
Or	setting	out,	thinking	one	will	roam	to	unfamiliar	distant	lands,	never	to
return	—
If	such	dreams	and	others	like	them	occur	when	one	is	not	sick,	they	are
indefinite	[with	respect	to	the	time	of	death],
And	 one	 may	 be	 released	 [from	 their	 indications]	 by	 means	 of	 the
[appropriate]	ritual	service.

If,	however,	such	dreams	continually	recur,
[This	indicates	that]	one	will	die	within	a	year.
	
If	one	should	dream	of	the	sun	and	moon	being	eclipsed,
Falling	to	the	plains,	or	repeatedly	setting,
One’s	father,	mother,	or	teacher	may	die,
And	it	is	said	that	if	they	are	sick	at	the	time,
Their	death	will	be	inevitable.
	
The	above	are	called	the	‘internal	signs	of	death’,
Which	are	slightly	more	difficult	[to	avert]
Through	ritual	deception	than	the	aforementioned	[external	signs].
SECRET	SIGNS	OF	DEATH
The	secret	signs	of	death	will	[now]	be	described.
When	the	external	and	internal	signs	of	death	occur,
They	can	be	averted	by	repeatedly	performing	the	
Ritual	Deception	of	Death
.
If,	however,	the	external	and	internal	signs	are	not	[successfully]	reversed,
One	should	then	examine	the	secret	signs	in	the	following	way:
Having	first	generated	the	mind	[aspiring]	to	supreme	enlightenment,
14
And	then	taken	refuge	and	offered	prayers,
One	should	examine,	on	the	morning	of	the	first	day	of	the	month,
The	flow	of	one’s	semen	or	menstrual	blood.
It	is	said	that	if	the	semen	of	a	man	is	blackish	yellow,
Or	if	the	menstrual	blood	of	a	woman	is	whitish,
Death	may	occur	after	two	months.
If	the	semen	of	a	man	is	reddish,
He	may	die	or	be	subjected	to	slander	after	six	months.
However,	if	its	[natural]	whiteness	is	undiminished,
[This	indicates	that]	there	is	no	obstacle	[to	life],
And	[the	semen]	should	be	inhaled	through	the	nose,	while	it	is	still	warm.
This	is	itself	a	rite	associated	with	the	
Ritual	Deception	of	Death
.
	
Furthermore,	if	semen	flows	without	any	[blissful]	sensation,

And	it	is	interspersed	with	quicksilver-like	globules,	the	size	of	sesame	seeds,
It	is	said	that	one	will	die	[imminently].
If	the	flow	of	a	woman’s	menstrual	blood	is	unceasing,
And	if	at	that	time	she	dreams	she	is	picking	red	flowers,
[This	indicates	that]	death	will	[soon]	follow.
Moreover,	if	a	man	has	continual	spermatorrhoea,
Even	when	not	engaged	in	sexual	intercourse,
It	is	said	that	he	may	die	after	four	months.
If	a	black	mole	suddenly	appears	for	the	first	time,
At	the	orifice	of	the	glans	penis,
Or	if	one	has	an	undistracted	and	constant	[sexual]	desire,	thinking	only	of
women,
And	one	allows	one’s	commitments	in	respect	of	the	third	empowerment	to
degenerate,
15
These	are	not	only	signs	of	death,
But	also	omens	that	one	will	later	proceed	to	[rebirth	in]	the	indestructible
hells.
[Therefore],	if	one	does	not	confess	[and	repair]	these	[degenerations]	fully,
One	will	experience	the	fierce	sufferings	of	the	hells.
In	order	for	the	confession	to	be	effective,	however,
You	should	perform	the	ritual	decepti

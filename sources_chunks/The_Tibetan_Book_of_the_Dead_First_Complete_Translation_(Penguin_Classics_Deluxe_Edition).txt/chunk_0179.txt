This	lion’s	roar	which	subdues	the	beguiling	force	of	the	lord	of	death,

Thus	Hayagr

varāja’s	accomplishment	of	long-life	will	be	attained,
And,	abiding	in	the	state	of	reality,	which	is	supreme	bliss,
Ignorance	and	other	dissonant	mental	states	will	be	uprooted,
The	 five	 poisons	 will	 be	 liberated,	 right	 where	 they	 are,	 without	 being
renounced,
And	the	habitual	tendencies	of	beginningless	cyclic	existence	will	be	swept
away.
	
[Through	 these	 innermost	 heart-mantras	 of	 the	 Four	 Great	 Wrathful
Gatekeepers],
The	four	beguiling	forces	will	be	destroyed	and	liberated	in	the	four	buddha-
bodies,
While	[externally]	bone	relics,	minor	relics,	and	rainbow	lights	will	appear
[during	the	cremation].
	
[How	wonderful!
Through	 the	 expansive	 diffusion	 of	 these	 enlightened	 intentions	 of	 the
buddha-mind	of	the	Sixty	Herukas,
The	mass	of	bewildered	thoughts	is	naturally	liberated,
While	 [externally]	 sounds,	 lights	 and	 rays,	 and	 bursts	 of	 fire	 or	 smoke,
spiralling	to	the	right	of	the	pyre,
As	well	as	rainbow	lights,	bone	relics,	and	small	relics,	and	other	signs,	will

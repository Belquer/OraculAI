To	you,	the	supreme	ancestors	of	the	buddhas	of	past,	present	and	future,

At	that	very	moment,	when	the	pure	inner	radiance	of	reality	dawns,
May	we	be	welcomed	by	the	father	Samantabhadra	before	us,
May	we	be	supported	by	the	mother	Samantabhadr

	behind	us;
And	 thus	 [encircled]	 may	 we	 be	 guided	 to	 the	 indivisible	 level	 of
Samantabhadra.

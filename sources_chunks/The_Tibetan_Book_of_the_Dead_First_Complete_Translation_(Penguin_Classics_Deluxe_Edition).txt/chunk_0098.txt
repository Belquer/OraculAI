cordance	with	the
content	of	the	profound	teachings	which	I	[formerly]	received.’	The	whole	point
is	that	one	should	not	be	distracted	from	a	state	in	which	the	oral	instructions	are
clearly	held	in	mind.
Then,	 without	 concocting	 thoughts,	 one	 should	 free	 oneself	 from	 the
[dualistic]	 framework	 of	 the	 object,	 which	 is	 to	 be	 transmigrated,	 and	 the
[subjective]	act	of	consciousness	transference.	Intrinsic	awareness	should	be
uncontrived	and	clear,	undistracted	
and	distinct,	stark	in	its	[coalescence	of]
radiance	and	emptiness.	Let	[this	experience]	remain	unmoving	for	a	prolonged
period.	If	one	expires	in	this	state,	the	mother	and	child	inner	radiances,	that	is	to
say	the	inner	radiance	of	the	ground	and	the	inner	radiance	of	the	path	which	is
the	focus	of	one’s	current	meditation,	will	encounter	each	other,	like	a	stream
meeting	the	main	river.	[Thus],	one	will	attain	the	uncreated	Buddha-body	of
Reality,	in	an	upward-moving	core-penetrating	manner;	and	liberation	will	be
instantaneous.	 This	 is	 called	 the	 ‘pure	 consciousness	 transference	 into	 the
Buddha-body	of	Reality’	because	those	who	have	highly	developed	experience
and	realisation	need	repeat	only	this,	again	and	again.	It	is	the	best	of	all	modes
of	consciousness	transference.
Now,	in	the	case	of	those	who	have	not	recognised	[intrinsic	awareness]	and
who	are	without	experience	and	realisation,	though	they	may	well	try	to	apply
this	consciousness	transference	into	the	Buddha-body	of	Reality,	[this	would	be
ineffectual].	It	would	be	[like	trying]	to	show	a	material	object	to	someone	who
has	been	blind	from	birth,	or	[like	trying]	to	point	out	a	[particular]	star	to	a	dog.
It	is	very	important,	therefore,	that	the	[method	of]	consciousness	transference
and	the	manner	of	its	clarification	correspond	to	the	mental	capacity	of	the
individual.
If,	however,	the	consciousness	transference	into	the	Buddha-body	of	Reality	is
effected	in	the	above	manner,	as	an	‘outer	sign’,	the	sky	will	become	clear	and
unclouded;	and	as	an	‘inner	sign’,	the	body	will	glow	radiantly	and	its	lustre	will
not	fade	for	a	long	time.	The	‘secret	signs’	include	the	appearance	of	the	white
syllable	AṂ	and	the	azure	syllable	HŪṂ	[among	the	cremated	relics].
24
Such	is	[the	instruction	on]	the	consciousness	transference	into	the	Buddha-
body	of	Reality.	SAMAYA!

Consciousness	Transference	into	the	Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource
If	one	chiefly	practises	the	generation	stage	[of	meditation]	and	particularly	if
one	has	little	certainty	with	regard	to	[the	experience	of]	emptiness,	one	should
undertake	 the	 consciousness	 transference	 into	 the	 Buddha-body	 of	 Perfect
Resource.	If	 one	 is	capable	 of	 securing	one’s	 body	in	 an	 upright	position,
adopting	as	suggested	before	the	appropriate	bodily	posture,	then	one	should	sit
upright	
and	 bring	 clearly	 to	 mind	 the	 visualisations	 of	 consciousness
transference,	as	previously	practised	during	one’s	training.	In	particular,	one
should	clearly	visualise	above	the	crown	of	one’s	head,	upon	a	lotus,	sun	and
moon	cushion,	one’s	spiritual	teacher	[in	the	form	of]	the	Buddha-body	of
Perfect	Resource.	[The	teacher	may	be	visualised	as]	the	great	Vajradhara,	or
Vajrasattva,	Avalokiteśvara,	and	so	forth,	and	especially	as	one’s	own	particular
meditational	deity,	following	whichever	[practices	of]	the	generation	stage	one
prefers.	One	should	meditate	clearly	on	the	essence	of	intrinsic	awareness	as	a
white	seminal	point,	[situated]	below	the	navel	at	the	lower	extremity	of	the
central	channel	within	the	body;	or	alternatively,	[one	should	clearly	visualise
here]	the	seed-syllable	of	one’s	very	own	meditational	deity:	a	white	syllable
AḤ,	an	azure	syllable	HŪṂ,	a	red	syllable	HRĪḤ,	and	so	forth,	as	appropriate.
25
It	will	be	best	if	one	[also]	clearly	visualises	that	[each	of]	the	orifices	[of	one’s
body]	is	blocked	by	the	syllable	HŪṂ;	but	if	this	is	not	visualised,	one	should
focus	one’s	consciousness	single-pointedly	within	the	c

I	bow	down	to	the	spiritual	teachers,	[embodiment	of]	the	Three	Buddha-
bodies:
To	the	Buddha-body	of	Reality,	Infinite	Light,	Amitābha;
To	the	Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource,	the	Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Lotus
Deities;
And	to	the	Buddha-body	of	Emanation,	Padmākara,	protector	of	beings.
	
This	
Great	Liberation	by	Hearing
,	the	skilful	means	which	liberates	yogins	of
average	 ability	 during	 the	 intermediate	 states,	 has	 three	 parts,	 namely:	 the
introduction,	the	main	subject	matter	[of	the	text]	and	the	conclusion.
INTRODUCTION
[All	aspirants]	should	experientially	cultivate	the	steps	of	guidance,	
3
	which	are
the	means	by	which	corporeal	beings	can	achieve	liberation.	Those	of	highest
acumen	 should	 certainly	 attain	 liberation	 [in	 their	 lifetime]	 through	 [the
application	of]	that	guidance.	But	if	liberation	does	not	occur	thereby,	[yogins]
should	 implement,	 during	 the	 intermediate	 state	 of	 the	 time	 of	 death,	 [the
appropriate	 procedure	 outlined	 in]	 the	
Consciousness	 Transference:	 Natural
Liberation	through	Recollection.
4
	Yogins	of	average	
ability	should	certainly	be

liberated	by	that.	If	liberation	is	not	effected	by	the	[application	of	consciousness
transference],	then	[the	recitation	of]	the	following	
Great	Liberation	by	Hearing
should	be	persistently	made	during	the	intermediate	state	of	reality.
First,	therefore,	yogins	should	examine	the	signs	of	death	in	accordance	with
the	 text	 entitled	
Natural	 Liberation	 through	 [Recognition	 of]	 the	 Visual
Indications	and	Signs	of	Death
,	also	known	as	the	
Mirror	which	Clarifies	the
Visible	 Indications	 of	 Death.
5
	 Thereupon,	 when	 the	 [inner]	 signs	 of	 the
processes	 of	 death	 are	 definitively	 and	 completely	 present,	 [the	 appropriate
procedure	as	outlined	in]	the	
Consciousness	Transference:	Natural	Liberation
through	Recollection
	should	be	applied.	Thus,	if	this	transference	is	effective,
there	will	be	no	need	to	read	aloud	the	
Great	Liberation	by	Hearing
.
If,	however,	the	transference	is	ineffective,	this	
Liberation	by	Hearing
	should
be	read	aloud	with	correct	pronunciation	and	clear	diction,	close	to	the	corpse.	If
the	corpse	is	not	present,	one	should	sit	next	to	the	bed	or	seat	of	the	deceased.
Then,	having	invoked	the	power	of	truth
6
	and	summoned	the	consciousness	[of
the	deceased],
7
	one	should	imagine	him	or	her	to	be	listening	in	one’s	presence
and	read	aloud	[this	
Great	Liberation	by	Hearing
].	At	this	time	the	relatives	and
close	friends	should	[be	advised	to]	show	restraint	because,	at	this	stage,	it	is	not
appropriate	to	cry	or	dramatically	express	one’s	grief.
8
If	the	deceased’s	body	is	present,	then	during	the	interval	which	follows	the
ceasing	of	respiration,
9
	this	
Great	Liberation	by	Hearing
	should	be	read	aloud
by	 a	 spiritual	 teacher,	 or	 by	 a	 spiritual	 sibling,	 sincere	 [practitioner],	 or	 a
sympathetic	friend,	placing	the	lips	[close]	to	the	ear	[of	the	deceased],	without
actually	touching.
10
THE	MAIN	SUBJECT	MATTER
Now	follows	the	actual	exegesis	of	the	
Liberation	by	Hearing
:
First,	one	should	make	extensive	offerings	to	the	Three	Precious	Jewels.
11
	If
these	are	unobtainable,	one	should	make	offerings	by	arraying	whatever	one	has
as	a	support	for	visualisation	and	mentally	emanating	an	immeasurable	[quantity
of	offerings].	Then	
one	should	recite,	three	or	seven	times,	the	
Aspirational
Prayer	[Calling]	to	the	Buddhas	and	Bodhisattvas	for	Assistance
.	After	this,	one
should	melodiously	recite	the	
Aspirational	Prayer	which	Protects	from	Fear	of

the	 Intermediate	 States
,	 the	
Aspirational	 Prayer	 which	 Rescues	 from	 the
Dangerous	Pathways	of	the	Intermediate	States
	and	the	
Root	Verses	of	the	[Six]
Intermediate	States
.
12
Thereafter,	this	
Great	Liberation	by	Hearing
	is	to	be	read	aloud	seven	or	three
times,	or	[as	many	times]	as	the	circumstances	permit.
[The	main	subject	matter	of	the	
Great	Liberation	by	Hearing
]	comprises	three
sections:	the

According	to	the	tradition	of	the	treasure-doctrines	(
gter-chos
),	there	are	four
kinds	of	seal	associated	with	the	transmission	of	such	teachings,	namely:	the	seal
of	commitment	(
samaya-rgya
),	the	seal	of	treasures	(
gter-rgya
),	the	seal	of
concealment	(
sbas-rgya
),	and	the	seal	of	entrustment	or	succession	(
gtadrgya
	
).

Indications	or	symptoms	of	untimely	death	(

by	ritual	purification,	as	recommended	in	this	text,	or	by	medical	means,	on
which	see

It	should	be	stressed	that	the	specificity	of	the	external	signs	of	impending
death	and	the	prognostications	listed	here	are	to	be	understood	in	the	context	of
the	spiritual	practices	outlined	in	other	chapters	of	this	cycle,	since	the
examination	cannot	be	undertaken	in	isolation	from	them.

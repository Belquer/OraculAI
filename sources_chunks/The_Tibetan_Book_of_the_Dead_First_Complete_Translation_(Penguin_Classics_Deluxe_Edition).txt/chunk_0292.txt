Wrath
	
drag-po’i	las
,	Skt.	
maraṇakriyā
One	of	the	
four	aspects	of	enlightened	activity
.	The	concept	of	wrath	in	the
context	of	Buddhist	
tantra
	should	not	be	understood	in	terms	of	even	the	subtlest
egocentric	violence	or	fierceness.	Wrath	here	refers	to	the	natural	transformative
process	of	
buddha-mind
,	the	aggressive	
natural	transformation
	of	the	deep-
seated	conditioning	which	underlies	mundane	deluded	consciousness	and	the
concomitant	psycho-physical	
aggregates
,	
elemental	properties
,	 and	 sensory
and	mental	processes.	See	
Four	Aspects	of	Enlightened	Activity

Two.

Yakṣa
	
gnod-sbyin
	
A	class	of	spirits	of	Indian	origin	who	assume	both	male
(
yakṣa
)	and	female	(
yakṣiṇ
ῑ
)	forms.	Frequently	depicted	as	holding	choppers,
cleavers,	and	swords,	they	are	said	to	inhabit	mountainous	areas	and	sylvan
groves,	 and	 if	 propitiated	 in	 the	 context	
of	 a	
means	 for	 attainment
	 (Skt.
sādhana
),	they	may	confer	the	common	
accomplishment
	
of	swift-footedness.
The	Tibetan	equivalent	
gnod-sbyin
	literally	means	‘granting	harm’,	emphasising
their	more	malign	attributes.
Yama
	
gshin-rje
See	under	
Yama	Dharmarāja
.

	
Yama	Dharmarāja
	
gshin-rje	chos-kyi	rgyal-po
The	embodiment	of	the	forces	of	
impermanence
	and	the	infallible	laws	of	
cause
and	effect
.	His	fierce	form	is	iconographically	depicted	holding	the	wheel	of
life’s	rebirth	processes	(
bhavacakra
,	Tib.	
srid-pa’i	’khor-lo
)	within	his	jaws,
indicating	 that	 the	 nature	 of	
cyclic	 existence
	 is	 in	 its	 entirety	 bound	 by
impermanence
	 and	 the	 laws	 of	
cause	 and	 effect
.	 In	 the	 context	 of	 the
intermediate	state	of	rebirth
	(
srid-pa’i	bar-do
)	he	personifies	the	process	of
confronting	in	death	the	nature	of	one’s	past	life’s	actions	and,	based	on	the
natural	laws	of	
cause	and	effect
,	he	personifies	the	process	of	‘judgement’	that
determines	the	consequential	outcome	of	such	
past	actions
.	See	Chapters	11	and
13	and	the	Introduction.	
Yama	Dharmarāja
	is	also	the	sixth	of	the	
six	sages
(
thub-pa	drug
),	who	form	one	subcategory	within	the	assembly	of	the	forty-two
peaceful	deities
.	See	Appendix	Two.
	
Yeshe	Tsogyal

Padmasambhava

maṇḍala

Vajrak

la
.	She	compiled	many	of	
Padmasambhava
’s	oral	teachings
and	concealed	them	throughout	Tibet	in	the	form	of	
treasures
	(
gter-ma
)	to	be
discovered	by	later	generations.
	
Yoga
	
rnal-’byor
The	Sanskrit	word	
yoga
,	literally	meaning	‘union’,	is	interpreted	in	Tibetan	to
mean	‘union	with	the	fundamental	nature	of	
reality
’.	In	Buddhism,	therefore,
yoga
	refers	to	the	methods	through	which	the	meditator	unites	with	the	qualities
of	the	
meditational	deity
	in	the	context	of	the	
generation	stage
,	and	the	nature
of	fundamental	
reality
	during	the	
perfection	stage
,	of	
meditation
.	In	terms	of
the	latter,	it	includes	mental	and	physical	practices,	which	refine	the	
energy
channels,
	and	mature	control	of	the	
vital	energies
	and	
seminal	points
	within
the	
subtle	body
.	These	practices	cultivate	
discriminative	awareness
,	and	the
coalescence	 of	
emptiness
	 respectively	 with	 the	
four	 delights
,	 with	
inner
radiance
,	and	with	non-conceptualisation.

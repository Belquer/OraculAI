(
rmi-lam	bar-do
),	the	
intermediate	state	of	the
time	of	death
	(
’chi-kha’i	bar-do
),	
the	intermediate	state	of	reality
	(
chos-nyid
bar-do
)	and	the	
intermediate	state	of	rebirth
	(
srid-pa’i	bar-do
).	During	each	of
these	phases,	the	consciousness	of	a	
sentient	being
	has	particular	experiential
qualities,	and	corresponding	to	these	qualities	of	experience	there	are	specific
meditative	techniques	conducive	to	realisation	of	the	ultimate	nature	of	mind	and
phenomena.	See	Chapter	3	and	individual	entries	below.
	
Intermediate	State	of	Dreams
	
rmi-lam	bar-do
The	intermediate	state	of	dreams	begins	from	the	moment	of	falling	asleep	and
ends	when	we	awake.	This	intermediate	state	offers	the	opportunity	for	the
practitioner	to	recognise	the	similarity	between	the	illusory	nature	of	dreams	and

that	of	our	waking	state.	This	practice	is	cultivated	in	the	context	of	
dream	yoga
where	the	ability	to	maintain	awareness	of	the	ultimate	nature	of	mind	and
phenomena	during	both	deep	sleep	and	dreaming	is	refined.
	
Intermediate	State	of	Living
	
rang-bzhin	bar-do
The	intermediate	state	of	living	begins	at	the	time	of	birth	and	continues	until	the
time	of	 death.	 Having	obtained	 a	 precious	human	 form	with	the	 ability	 to
recognise	our	actual	condition,	the	opportunity	arises	to	adopt	a	way	of	life	and
to	engage	in	the	practices	that	lead	to	
buddhahood
.	See	Chapters	3	and	1,	2,	4,
5,	6	and	7.
	
Intermediate	State	of	Meditative	Concentration
	
bsam-gtan	bar-do
The	intermediate	state	of	meditative	concentration	entered	during	the	waking
state	 provides	 the	 opportunity	 for	 the	 practitioner	 to	 cultivate	
meditative
equipose
	(
samāhita
	
,	Tib.	
mnyam-bzhag
)	and	thereby	to	achieve	stability	in	the
generation
	 and	
perfection	 stages
	 of	 meditation.	 This	 in	 turn	 deepens	 an
unbroken	awareness	of	the	ultimate	nature	of	mind	and	phenomena	in	post-
meditative	activities	and	prepares	the	meditator	for	the	
intermediate	state	of	the
time	of	death
.	See	Chapters	3	and	1,	2,	4,	5,	6	and	7.
	
Intermediate	State	of	Reality
	
chos-nyid	bar-do
The	intermediate	state	of	actual	reality	arises	after	the	
intermediate	state	of	the
time	of	death
	(
’chi-kha’i	bar-do
)	and	before	the	
intermediate	state	of	rebirth
(
srid-pa’i	
bar-do
).	Here	the	opportunity	occurs,	based	on	the	practices	adopted
during	 one’s	 lifetime,	 to	 recognise	 the	
natural	 purity
	 and	
natural
transformation
	 qualities	 of	 the	 ultimate	 nature	 of	 mind	 in	 the	 form	 of
luminosities,	rays,	sounds	and	
meditational	deities
.	See	Chapters	3	and	1	1.
	
Intermediate	State	of	Rebirth
	
srid-pa’i	bar-do
The	intermediate	state	of	rebirth	is	entered	after	the	
intermediate	state	of
reality
	
when	the	consciousness	arises	in	the	form	of	a	
mental	body
,	conditioned
by	the	individual’s	inheritance	of	
past	actions
,	and	the	individual	begins	to
experience	both	the	surroundings	where	he	or	she	died	and	the	unfolding	of
experiential	states	driven	by	the	momentum	of	
past	actions
.	If	
liberation
	from
cyclic	existence
	is	not	achieved	during	this	intermediate	state	it	comes	to	an	end
at	the	moment	of	conception.	Since	consciousness	is	said	to	possess	certain
heightened	qualities	during	this	period	there	is	a	potential	to	achieve	
liberation
,

or	at	the	very	least	a	favourable	rebirth,	at	various	key	stages	as	this	state	is
traversed.	See	Chapters	3	and	1	1.
	
Intermediate	State	of	the	Tme	of	Death
	
’chi-kha’i	bar-do
The	intermediate	state	of	the	time	of	death	is	entered	at	the	time	when	the
process	of	dying	definitively	begins,	and	ends	with	the	onset	of	the	
intermediate
state	of	reality
.	It	includes	the	gradual	dissolution	of	the	five	elements	and	their
associated	modes	of	consciousness	and	culminates	with	the	arising	of	the	
inner
radiante
	of	the	ground	(
gzhi’i	’od-gsal
).	The	natural	arising	of	
inner	radiance
immediately	after	respiration	ceases	is	regarded	as	a	supreme	opportunity	to
realise	the	
Buddha-body	of	Reality
.	See	Chapters	3,	8,	10	and	1	1

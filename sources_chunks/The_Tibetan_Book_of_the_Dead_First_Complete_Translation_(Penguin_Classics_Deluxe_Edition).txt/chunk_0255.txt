conventionally	and	their	ontology	must	be	accepted	as	valid.
Such	a	metaphysical	position	is	designated	the	‘Middle	Way’	in	that	it	is	the	mid-
point	between	the	extremes	of	total	non-existence	of	
reality
,	or	
nihilism
,	and	the
positing	 of	 an	 absolute,	 independent	 existence	 of	
reality
,	 or	
eternalism
.
Founded	by	
Nāgārjuna
	in	the	second	century	AD,	the	
Madhyamaka
	
school	later
evolved	two	subdivisions:	
Prāsaṅgika
	and	
Svātantrika
,	based	on	the	different
interpretations	of	
Nāgārjuna
’s	views	which	were	made	by	
Buddhapālita
	
(later
elucidated	by	
Candrak
ῑ
rti
)	and	
Bhavaviveka
	respectively.	The	Tibetan	tradition,
while	recognising	
Bhavaviveka
’s	important	contribution	to	Buddhist	logic	and
philosophy,	considers	the	
Prāsaṅgika
	technique	of	
reductio	ad	absurdum
	to	be
the	 most	 refined	 logical	 method	 in	 Buddhism	 for	 establishing	 the	 view	 of
emptiness
.	The	distinctive	feature	of	the	
Prāsaṅgika
	school	is	its	total	denial	of
any	 ontology	 implying	
inherent	 existence
	 of	 either	 external	 objects	 or
subjective	
conssciousness
.	 There	 is	 also,	 according	 to	 some	 Tibetan
interpretations,	the	tradition	known	as	the	Great	
Madhyamaka
	which	in	the
course	of	meditative	insight	distinguishes	between	the	intrinsic	
emptiness
	of
phenomena	(
rang-stong
)	and	the	extrinsic	
emptiness
	of	pure	
buddha	attributes
(
gzhan-stong
).

dissonant	 mental	 states
(deluded	 consciousness),	 thoughts	 (mental	 consciousness),	 sights	 (visual

Eighteen	Hells
	
dmyal-ba	bco-brgyad
,	Skt.	
aṣṭadaśanaraka
States	of	existence	within	the	cycle	of	rebirth,	conditioned	by	our	past	actions,
where	the	experience	of	
suffering
,	arising	from	hatred,	anger	and	fear,	is	most
intense	and	extended.	
Abhidharma
	literature	mentions	two	main	types	of	such
hell-like	existences,	characterised	by	the	dominance	of	either	freezing	coldness
or	burning	heat.	These	two	are	in	turn	divided	into	eighteen	subcategories.

Eight-four	Thousand	Aspects	of	the	[Sacred]	Teaching
	
chos-sgo	brgyad-khri
bzhi	stong
The	
Buddha
’s	teachings	are	said	to	comprise	eighty-four	thousand	aspects	or
approaches,	when	they	are	classified	according	to	their	function	as	an	antidote.	It
is	said	that	there	are	eighty-four	thousand	
dissonant	mental	states
,	comprising
twenty-one	 thousand	 aspects	 respectively	 of	
attachment
	 (
rāga
),	
aversion
(
dveśa
),	
delusion
	(
moha
),	and	their	combination;	and	there	is	an	antidote	within
the	
Buddha
’s	teachings	corresponding	to	each	of	these	
dissonant	mental	states
.
	
Elemental	Forces
	
’byung-po
,	Skt.	bhūta
A	category	of	forces	associated	with	the	elements:	earth,	water,	fire,	wind	and
space,	which	are	said	to	move	through	the	body	in	a	monthly	cycle	and	to	whom
certain	illnesses	and	paediatric	disorders	are	attributed	in	Tibetan	medicine.
These	may	be	appeased	or	brought	back	into	balance	by	the	application	of
medicinal	antidotes,	or	by	the	counteracting	rituals	prescribed	in	the	
tantras
,	as
outlined	in	Chapter	9.

Empowerment
	
dbang-bskur
,	Skt.	
abhiṣeka
A	ritual	ceremony	performed	by	accomplished	
spiritual	teachers
	and	
lineage
holders
	
to	empower	prospective	trainees,	prior	to	their	engaging	in	the	various
vehicles	and	specific	practices	of	the	
tantras
.	The	meditative	processes	of	the
empowerment	ritual	are	intended	to	activate	the	potentials	inherent	within	the
body,	speech	and	mind	of	the	trainee,	in	other	words	to	awaken	the	seed	of	the
natural	ability	to	engage	in	the	practice.	Such	empowerment	ceremonies	are	an
essential	prerequisite	for	the	practice	of	
tantra
	in	the	Buddhist	tradition.	See	also
Four	Empowerments.
	
Emptiness
	
stong-pa-nyid
,	Skt.	
śūnyatā
The	ultimate	nature	of	
reality
.	According	to	the	
Madhyamaka
	school	it	is	the
total	 absence	 of	
inherent	 existence
	 and	 self-identity	 with	 respect	 to	 all
phenomena.	 Its	 synonyms	 include	
ultimate	 truth
	 (Skt.	
paramārthasatya
),
actual	reality
	(Skt.	
dharmatā
	
),	and	suchness	(Skt.	
tathatā
).	Though	presented
in	the	scriptures	of	both	the	
Lesser	Vehicle
	and	the	
Greater	Vehicle,
	the	theory
of	emptiness	is	most	systematically	developed	in	the	writings	of	the	second-
century	Buddhist	thinker	
Nāgārjuna
,	the	founder	of	the	
Madhyamaka
	school.
According	to	this	view,	all	things	and	events,	both	external	and	internal,	are
devoid	 of	 any	 independent,	 intrinsic	 reality	 that	 constitu

or
Vajradhara
.	Other	
tantra
	texts	and	
lineages
	claim	that	
Vajradhara
	is	a	form
assumed	 by	
Śākyamuni	Buddha
	 when	 giving	 esoteric	 teachings	 on	
tantra
.
Vajradhara
	 is	 said	 to	 become	 manifest	 when	 one	 has	 totally	 overcome	 all
dualistic	conceptions	and	actualised	
buddhahood
.	He	is	usually	depicted	as
seated	and	holding	a	
vajra
	and	bell	in	his	crossed	palms.

Vajrasattva
	
rdo-rje	sems-dpa’
Vajrasattva
,	or	in	literal	translation	‘the	spiritual	hero	of	indestructible	reality’,
has	two	principal	forms.	Firstly,	in	the	context	of	the	
Guhyagarbha	tantra
,	and
related	 texts,	 he	 is	 identified	 with	 the	 peaceful	 male	
buddha
	
Akṣobhya-
Vajrasattva
.	See	Appendix	Two.	Secondly,	in	the	context	of	the	
preliminary
practices
	(
sngon-’gro
)	of	
meditation
,	the	recitation	of	
Vajrasattva
’s	
Hundred-
syllable	Mantra
	(
yig-brgya
)	purifies	
negativities
,	
obsurations
,	
transgressions
,
and	
downfalls
	(see	Chapter	1).	In	this	latter	context,	
Vajrasattva
	is	visualised	as
white	in	colour,	dressed	in	the	silken	garments	and	ornaments	of	a	
bodhisattva
,
and	holding	a	
vajra
	in	his	right	palm	close	to	the	heart	and	a	bell	in	his	left	hand
close	to	the	left	side	of	his	hip.	Sometimes,	both	forms	of	
Vajrasattva
	are
integrated	in	a	single	practice,	as	in	Chapter	5	of	the	present	work,	where
practitioners	first	visualise	the	white	form	of	
Vajrasattva
,	before	visualising	the
forty-two	
peaceful	deities
,	including	
Akṣobhya-Vajrasattva
,	within	their	hearts.
As	a	
lineage	holder
,	
Vajrasattva
	is	credited	with	the	transmission	of	
Atiyoga
into	the	human	world,	appearing	in	the	form	of	the	
deva	Adhicitta
	
(
lhag-sems-
can
)	before	
Prahevajra
	(
dga’-rab	rdo-rje
)	in	a	vision.	According	to	the	
Great
Perfection
,	
Vajrasattva
	 is	 sometimes	 used	 synonymously	 to	 indicate	 the
Buddha-body	of	Reality
,	and	as	such	is	identical	to	
Samantabhadra
.

The	term	‘vehicle’	suggests	a	dynamic	momentum	leading	to	the	attainment	of
nirvāṇa
.	Although	from	one	standpoint	there	may	be	as	many	vehicles	as	there
are	thoughts	arising	in	the	mind,	the	
sacred	teachings
	are	classified	into	distinct
vehicles	according	to	their	power.	Accordingly,	the	expression	‘two	vehicles’
refers	to	the	distinction	between	the	
Lesser	Vehicle
	and	the	
Greater	Vehicle
,	the
expression	‘
three	Vehicles
’	or	‘three	causal	vehicles’	refers	to	the	vehicles	of
pious	attendants
,	
hermit	buddhas
	and	
bodhisattvas
.	The	division	into	‘
nine
vehicles
’,	which	corresponds	to	the	
Nyingma
	classification,	includes	the	three
causal	vehicles	of	the	
pious	attendants
,	
hermit	buddhas
	and	
bodhisattvas

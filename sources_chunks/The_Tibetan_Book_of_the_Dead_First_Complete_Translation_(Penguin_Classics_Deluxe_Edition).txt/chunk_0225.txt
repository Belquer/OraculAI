nirmāṇakāya
The	Buddha-body	of	Emanation	is	the	visible	and	usually	physical	manifestation
of	fully	enlightened	beings	which	arises	spontaneously	from	the	expanse	of	the
Buddha-body	of	Reality
,	whenever	appropriate,	in	accordance	with	the	diverse
dispositions	of	sentient	beings.	The	
sūtras
	refer	to	three	types	of	emanational
body	in	relation	to	
Sākyamuni	Buddha
:	(i)	emanational	birth	in	
Tusita
,	(ii)
emanational	art	forms,	and	(iii)	supreme	emanation	as	one	of	the	thousand
buddhas
	of	the	
auspicious	aeon
.	From	the	distinctive	
Nyingma
	perspective,
however,	the	three	types	of	emanational	body	comprise:	1)	natural	emanations
(
rang-bzhin	sprul-sku
),	which	are	the	
buddhas
	of	the	
five	enlightened	families
such	as	Vairocana	in	the	forms	they	assume	when	appearing	before	
bodhisattvas
of	the	highest	level;	2	)	supreme	emanations	(
mchog-gi	sprul-sku
)	 such	 as
Sākyamuni	Buddha
	and	the	other	
buddhas
	of	this	aeon	who	initiate	a	new
teaching,	and	3)	diversified	emanations	(
sna-tshogs	sprul-sku
),	including	oases,
food,	medicine	and	other	such	material	manifestations,	which	are	of	benefit	to
living	 beings,	 as	 well	 as	 emanational	 art	 forms	 (
bzo-bo	 sprul-sku
)	 and
emanational	births	(
skye-ba	sprul-sku
),	such	as	those	taken	by	
Sākyamuni
	in
previous	lives,	for	example	as	Prince	Satśvetaketu	in	the	god	realm	of	
Tuṣita
.
	
Buddha-body	of	Form
	
gzugs-sku
,	Skt.	
rūpakāya
According	to	the	literature	of	the	
Lesser	Vehicle
	(
h
ῑ
nayāna
)	the	Buddha-body	of
Form	 refers	 to	 the	 thousand	
buddhas
	 of	 the	
auspicious	 aeon
,	 including
Sākyamuni
.	 In	 the	
Greater	 Vehicle
,	 however,	 the	 term	 includes	 both	 the
Buddha-body	 of	 Perfect	 Resource
	 and	 the	
Buddha-bodyof	 Emanation
.
According	to	
Atiyoga
,	when	the	Buddha-body	of	Form	is	actualised	through	the
practices	of	
All-surpassing	Realisation
	
,	a	
rainbow-liht	body
	is	attained,	and
this	realisation	is	known	as	the	Buddha-body	of	Great	Transformation	(’
pho-ba
chen-po’i	sku
).
	
Buddha-body	 of	 Perfect	 Resource
	
longs-spyod	 rdzogs-pa’i	 sku
,	 Skt.
sambhogakāya

The	Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource	refers	to	the	luminous,	immaterial,	and
unimpeded	 reflection-like	 forms	 of	 the	 pure	 energy	 of	 enlightened	 mind,
exemplified	in	the	case	of	our	text	by	the	assembly	of	the	forty-two	peaceful
deities	and	the	fifty-eight	wrathful	deities	(see	Appendix	Two),	which	become
spontaneously	present	(
lhun-grub
)	and	naturally	manifest	(
rang-snang
)	at	very
high	levels	of	realisation,	that	is	to	say	at	the	point	at	which	the	duality	between
subject	and	object	
dissolves.	The	
intermediate	state	of	reality
	(
chos-nyid	bar-
do
)	is	considered	to	be	an	optimum	time	for	the	realisation	of	the	Buddha-body
of	Perfect	Resource.
	
Buddha-body	ofReality
	
chos-sku
,	Skt.	
dharmakāya
The	Buddha-body	of	Reality	is	the	ultimate	nature	or	essence	of	the	
enlightened
mind
,	 which	 is	 uncreated	 (
skye-med
),	 free	 from	 the	 limits	 of	 conceptual
elaboration	(
spros-pa’i	mtha’-bral
	),	empty	of	inherent	existence	(
rang-bzhin-
gyis	stong-pa
),	naturally	radiant,	beyond	duality	and	spacious	like	the	sky.	The
intermediate	state	of	the	time	of	death
	(
’chi-kha’i	bar-do
)	is	considered	to	be
an	optimum	time	for	the	realisation	of	the	Buddha-body	of	Reality.

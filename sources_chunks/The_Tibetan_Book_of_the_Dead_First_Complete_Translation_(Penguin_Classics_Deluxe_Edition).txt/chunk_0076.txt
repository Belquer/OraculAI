wing	portents	of	its	demise
Will	arise	prior	[to	the	time	of	death]:
Loss	of	appetite,	dullness	of	the	sense	faculties,
A	feeling	of	anger	which	consumes	body,	speech	and	mind,

Distracted	or	depressed	thoughts,
Disturbed	dreams,	character	changes,	and	fading	complexion.
These	are	the	portents	[indicating]	that	life	[-threatening]	hindrances	may
arise.
	
More	 particularly,	 there	 are	 the	 following	 specifically	 physical	 signs	 of
death:
7
If	the	fingernails	and	toenails	become	bloodless	or	lustreless,
[This	indicates]	death	after	nine	months,	less	half	a	day.
If	the	cornea	of	the	eyes	begin	to	cloud	over,
[This	indicates]	death	after	five	months.
If	the	hair	on	the	nape	of	the	neck	grows	upwards,
[This	indicates]	death	after	three	months.
	
[Then	 again,	 more	 generally],	 if	 one	 urinates,	 defecates	 and	 sneezes
simultaneously,
This	too	is	an	indication	of	death.
Also,	if	one’s	urine	falls	in	two	forks,
If	one’s	muscles	become	utterly	loose	and	flabby,
If	faeces	are	excreted	and	semen	ejaculated	simultaneously,
If	one’s	body	odour	changes	dramatically,
If	one’s	conduct	changes	dramatically,
If	one	blushes	little	and	one’s	complexion	becomes	pallid,
If	the	tone	of	one’s	voice	becomes	thin,	and	one’s	eyes	become	sunken,
If	the	space	above	the	bridge	of	the	nose	becomes	exfoliated,
If	the	eyes	do	not	clearly	perceive	forms,
Or	else	if	they	perceive	incorrectly,	and	so	forth,
If	[the	ears]	do	not	hear,	or	else	hear	incorrectly,
If	[the	nose]	does	not	smell,	or	else	smells	incorrectly,
If	[the	tongue]	does	not	taste,	or	else	tastes	incorrectly,
If	the	point	between	the	eyebrows	is	effaced,
Or	evaporation	ceases	from	the	crown	of	the	head,
These	[signs]	may	all	indicate	that	one	has	fallen	into	the	hands	of	the	Lord	of
Death.

Furthermore,	while	in	good	health,
[The	following	technique	for	eliciting	indications	can	also	be	applied]:

If,	when	the	[closed]	eyes	are	pressed	with	the	fingers,
The	[minute]	circles	of	light	which	appear
Are	absent	from	the	lower	part	of	the	left	eye,
[This	indicates	that]	one	may	die	after	six	months,
But	if	they	are	absent	from	the	upper	part	[of	that	eye],
One	may	die	after	three	months.
If	these	[same	circles]	are	absent	from	the	direction	of	the	[left]	nostril,
[This	indicates	that]	one	may	die	after	one	month.
If	they	are	absent	from	the	direction	of	the	[left]	ear,
[This	indicates	that]	one	may	die	after	two	months.
	
[Resuming	this	process,	focusing	on	the	right	eye]:
If	[the	circles]	are	absent	from	the	lower	part	of	the	right	eye,
One	should	know	that	one	may	die	after	ten	days.
If	they	are	absent	from	the	upper	part	[of	the	right	eye],
[This	indicates	that]	one	may	die	after	five	days.
If	they	are	absent	from	the	direction	of	the	[right]	ear,
[This	indicates	that	one	may	die]	after	three	days;
And	if	they	are	absent	from	the	direction	of	the	[right]	nostril,
One	should	know	that	one	may	die	after	two	days,	even	if	one	is	not	sick.
	
Secondly,	if	when	the	ears	are	cupped	with	the	fingers,
No	humming	sound	is	heard	throughout	an	entire	day,
9
One	should	know	that	one	might	die	after	six	years.
If	it	is	absent	for	two	days,
One	may	die	after	six	years	less	two	months.
Similarly,	for	each	additional	day	[that	the	sound	is	absent],
[This	indicates	that]	one	may	die,	decrementally,	after	three	fewer	months.
That	is,	if	[the	sound]	is	absent	for	a	third	or	fourth	day,
Death	may	come	after	three	[or	six]	fewer	months,	respectively.
It	has	also	been	said	that	the	number	of	days	[indicated]	might	not	necessarily
be	definite.
There	are	also	other	[external]	signs	of	death,	such	as:
If	one	feels	[continuously]	angry	and	short-tempered,
If	one	feels	fearful,	wherever	one	may	be,
If	one’s	positive	perspective,	devotion,	and	similar	qualities	ebb	away,

If	one	feels	aversion	towards	saintly	beings,
If	one	feels	depressed,	wherever	one	may	be,	and	[constantly]	wishes	to	go
[elsewhere],
If	one	wishes	to	be	separated	from	sympathetic	Buddhist	companions,
If	one	delights	in	the	social	diversions	and	d

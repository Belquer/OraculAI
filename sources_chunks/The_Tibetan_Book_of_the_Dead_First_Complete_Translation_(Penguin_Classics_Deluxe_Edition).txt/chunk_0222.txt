Bewilderment	is	the	confusion	arising	from	the	subject-object	dichotomy	and
fundamental	ignorance
,	on	the	basis	of	which	rebirth	in

A	class	of	malign	spirits	that	are	thought	to	frequent	the	atmosphere	and	the
earth,	many	of	whom	were	bound	under	an	oath	of	allegiance	to	Buddhism	by
Padmasambhava
	 during	 the	 eighth	 century.	 Their	 power	 to	 generate	 life-
threatening	obstacles,	to	assail	bereaved	persons,	and	so	forth	can	be	averted	by
counteracting	rituals.

Bessing
	
byinrlabs
,	Skt.	
adhiṣṭhāna
	
In	the	Buddhist	context,	the	term	blessing
should	not	be	understood	in	terms	of	grace	as	in	the	case	of	theistic	religions.
Rather,	it	relates	to	the	sense	of	inspiration	received	from	an	external	source,
which	 transforms	 or	 awakens	 the	 potentials	 inherent	 within	 an	 individual’s
mental	continuum.	Thus,	the	Tibetan	word	
byinrlabs
	
is	interpreted	to	mean:	‘to
be	transformed	through	inspiring	magnificence’.

	
Blood-drinking	[Heruka]

heruka
The	Sanskrit	word	
heruka
	is	interpreted	to	mean	‘one	who	delights	in	drinking
blood’	or	‘one	who	holds	a	skull	filled	with	blood’,	symbolising	the	wrathful
dynamic	transformation	of	the	deep-seated	
dissonant	mental	states
.
	
Blood-filled	skull
	
dung-dmar
,	Skt.	
bhandha/bhānṇḍaka
In	tantric	iconography,	
meditational	deities
	are	often	depicted	holding	skull-
cups	filled	with	blood.	The	human	skull	symbolises	mortality	and	impermanence
while	the	blood	represents	the	transmutation	of	
dissonant	mental	states
	into
pristine	cognition

Bodhicitta
	
byang-chub-kyi	sems
An	altruistic	intention	or	aspiration	to	attain	full	
enlightenment
	for	the	benefit
of	all	beings.	
Bodhicitta
	is	cultivated	on	the	basis	of	certain	mental	attitudes,
principal	among	them	being	the	development	of	
love
	and	great	
compassion
towards	all	beings	equally.	The	Tibetan	tradition	speaks	of	two	major	systems
for	training	one’s	
mind
	
in	the	generation	of	
bodhicitta
:	the	first	is	
Atiśa
’s	‘seven-
point	cause	and	effect’	and	the	second	is	
Śāntideva
’s	‘equality	and	exchange	of
oneself	with	others’.	A	genuine	generation	of	
bodhicitta
	is	attained	only	when,
through	the	training	of	the	
mind
,	the	aspiration	to	attain	full	
enlightenment
becomes	spontaneous	and	no	longer	requires	any	deliberate	exertion.	At	that
stage	 the	 individual	 becomes	 a	
bodhisattva
.	 Literally,	
bodhi
	 means
‘
enlighhtenment
’,	and	
citta
,	‘
mind
’.	 The	 literature	 of	 the	
Greater	Vehicle
speaks	of	two	types	of	
bodhicitta
:	the	conventional	
bodhicitta
	and	the	ultimate
bodhicitta
.	The	former	refers	to	that	aspect	of	
bodhicitta
	defined	above,	whereas
the	latter	refers	to	the	
mind	of	enlightenment
	
i.e.
	the	discriminative	awareness
directly	realising	
emptiness
,	which	is	induced	by	the	above	altruistic	
aspiration.
The	 cultivation	 of	 an	 altruistic	 intention	 (
sems-bskyed
,	 Skt.	
cittotpāda
)	 is
included	among	the	
preliminary	practices
	(
sngon-’gro
),	in	which	context	it	is
said	to	be	an	antidote	for	envy	or	self-centred	ambition.	In	the	
tantras
,	however,
the	 term	
bodhicitta
	 (
byang-sems
)	 specifically	 refers	 to	 the	 white/male	 and
red/female	
generative	essences
	of	the	body.
	
Bodhisattva
	
byang-chub	sems-dpa’
A	spiritual	trainee	dedicated	to	the	cultivation	and	fulfilment	of	the	
altruistic
intention	 to	 attain	 enlightenment
,	 who	 is	 gradually	 traversing	 the	 five

bodhisattva
	
paths
	
(
pañcamārga
)	and	ten	
bodhisattva
	levels	(
daśabhūmi
).	An
essential	element	of	this	commitment	to	work	for	others	is	the	determination
purposely	to	remain	within	
cyclic	existence
	instead	o

The	southern

.
	
Stūpa
	
mchod-rten
A	 sacred	 object	 representative	 of	
buddha-mind
.	
Stūpas
	 were	 originally	 a
symbol	of	the	
Buddha-body	of	Reality
,	constructed	in	a	dome-shape	to	hold	the
remains	of	
Śākyamuni	Buddha
.	The	veneration	of	
stūpas
	is	closely	connected	to
the	earliest	phase	of	the	
Greater	Vehicle
	in	ancient	India,	where	the	original
stūpa
	design	developed	within	the	central	monastic	assembly	hall	(Skt.	
caitya
).
The	
stūpas
	commonly	seen	in	Tibetan	cultural	areas	are	constructed	to	a	specific
architectural	design,	usually	in	the	shape	of	a	dome,	raised	on	a	square	base	of
several	layers,	from	which	rises	a	multilayered	spire.	In	monasteries	and	sacred
sites,	a	series	of	eight	
stūpas
	is	frequently	constructed,	symbolising	different
events	in	the	life	of	
Śākyamuni	Buddha
.	Others	are	extraordinarily	large,	like
those	 of	
Baudhanāth
	
and	
Svayambhū
	 in	 Nepal,	 or	
Sanchi
	 in	 India	 and

Borabudor
	in	Indonesia,	and	some	enclose	within	them	entire	
maṇḍalas
	of
deities,	such	as	the	
Pelkhor	Chode
	 at	
Gyantse
	 in	
Tsang
	and	the	Memorial
Chorten
	 in	
Thimphu
,	 Bhutan.	 The	 symbolism	 of	 the	
stūpa
	 is	 complex,
representing	 the	 progression	 to	
buddhahood
,	 the	
five	 elements
,	 the	 five
pristine	cognitions
,	and	so	forth.	Smaller	reliquary	
stūpas
	are	frequently	built	as
a	funerary	memorial	to	important	
spiritual	teachers
,	 often	 enshrining	 their
sacred	ashes	or	embalmed	remains.
	
Subduer
	
rtsad-du	gcod-pa
According	to	the	terminology	of	the	
Nyingma
	school,	the	six	
herukas
	of	the
assembly	of	fifty-eight	
wrathful	deities
	are	given	the	title	‘subduer’,	referring	to
their	activity	of	
natural	transformation
	with	respect	to	the	
dissonant	mental
states

nature	of	reality,	in	other	words	the	lack	of	
self-identity
	of	both	oneself	and
phenomena.	The	level	of	experience	of	an	
ārya

Subtle	Body
	
phra-ba’i	lus
	Skt.	
sūkṣmakāya
In	contrast	to	our	gross	physical	body,	which	is	composed	of	flesh,	bones	and
blood,	the	subtle	body	comprises	a	network	of	subtle	
energy	channels
,	
vital
energies
	and	
seminal	points
	of	energy.	This	form	arises	as	a	natural	expression
of	the	interaction	of	the	subtle	
mind
	and	the	subtle	
vital	energies
	on	which	it
depends.	See	the	Introductory	Commentary	by	HH	the	Dalai	Lama.	The	most
advanced	level	of	subtle	body,	known	in	the	
tantras
	as	the	pure	
illusory	body
(
sgyu-lus
),	 is	 experienced	 only	 when	 an	 indivisible	 unity	 of	
buddha-body
,
speech
	and	
mind
	has	been	a

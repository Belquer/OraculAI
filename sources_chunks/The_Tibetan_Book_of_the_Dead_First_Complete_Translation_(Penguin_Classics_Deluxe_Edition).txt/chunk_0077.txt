one	feels	depressed,	wherever	one	may	be,	and	[constantly]	wishes	to	go
[elsewhere],
If	one	wishes	to	be	separated	from	sympathetic	Buddhist	companions,
If	one	delights	in	the	social	diversions	and	distracting	activities	of	cyclic
existence,
Or	if	one	feels	excessive	attachment,	aversion,	pride,	or	envy,
These	may	all	indicate	that	one	has	fallen	into	the	hands	of	the	Lord	of	Death.
	
These,	[the	above],	are	called	‘the	external	signs	of	death’,
Which,	it	is	said,	can	be	averted	by	the	ritual	deception	of	death.
The	techniques,	by	which	they	are	averted,	should	be	studied,
By	referring	to	the	
Ritual	Deception	of	Death
	[chapter,	which	follows].
INTERNAL	SIGNS	OF	DEATH
The	investigation	of	the	internal	signs	of	death
Comprises	the	examination	of	vital	breath	and	the	examination	of	dreams.
	
Examination	of	the	Vital	Breath
10
	
Around	the	time	of	the	[vernal	or	autumnal]	equinox,
At	daybreak	on	the	first	day	[of	the	lunar	month],
One	should	sit	upright,	with	the	body	in	the	seven-point	posture	of	Vairocana.
Then,	one	should	observe	the	vital	breath,	and	note	from	which	[nostril]	this
emerges.
If,	at	this	time,	the	vital	breath	is	moving	through	the	left	nostril,
Then,	for	a	period	of	three	days,	the	breath	will	continue	to	move	exclusively
through	the	left	nostril,
But	then	on	the	fourth	day	it	will	change,
And	proceed	to	move	through	the	right	nostril	for	three	days.
Thus	it	will	alternate	in	this	way	every	three	days	between	the	two	nostrils.
	
[Observe	this	process	and]	count	the	number	of	days	diligently,	and	do	not
make	a	mistake.

If	no	error	is	made	[in	the	counting],	and	if	the	breath	moves	successively	in
this	way,
And	then	begins	to	move	erratically	after	one	and	a	half	months,
It	is	said	that	one	may	die	after	[a	further]	six	months.
If	the	breath	begins	to	move	erratically	after	one	month,
It	is	said	that	severe	misfortunes	may	occur.
If	it	begins	to	move	erratically	after	two	weeks,
[It	is	said	that]	serious	illness	may	occur.
If	it	moves	erratically	after	five	days,
11
[It	is	said	that]	slander	and	calumny	may	occur.
If	[the	breath]	does	not	alternate	[from	one	nostril	to	the	other]	over	a	ten-day
period,
Then,	as	soon	as	it	does	change,	one	may	die.
If	it	moves	simultaneously	through	both	nostrils	and	the	mouth,
[This	indicates	that]	one	may	die	after	half	a	day.
And	if	it	ceases	to	move	through	the	nose	and	instead	moves	only	through	the
mouth,
It	is	said	that	one	will	die	immediately.
	
Examination	of	the	Signs	of	Death	which	Occur	in	Dreams
12
	
[First,	one	should	know	that]	those	dreams	which	occur	in	the	late	evening	or
around	midnight	are	unreliable,
But	if	one	dreams	between	dawn	and	daybreak	that:
One	is	riding	a	cat	or	a	white	monkey	with	a	red	face,
While	moving	further	and	further	towards	the	east,
It	is	said	that	this	is	a	sign	of	death	caused	by	king	spirits.
13
If	one	dreams	of	riding	a	tiger,	fox,	or	corpse,
Or	of	riding	a	buffalo,	pig,	camel,	or	donkey,
While	moving	further	and	further	towards	the	south,
This	is	a	sign	of	death	[indicating	that]	one	has	fallen	into	the	hands	of	Yama.
	
Furthermore,	if	one	dreams	of	eating	faeces,
Of	wearing	black	clothes	of	yak	hair,	while	plunging	downwards,
Of	being	trapped	in	a	wicker-basket	or	snare,
Of	being	bound	with	iron	chains,

Or	of	copulating	repeatedly	with	a	black	figure	or	animal,
These	are	[also]	signs	[which	are	indicative]	of	death.
	
If	one	dreams	of	being	disembowelled	by	a	fierce	black	woman,
And	that	one’s	entrails	are	spilling	out,
Or	that	a	black	man	arrives,	wielding	an	iron	mace,
And	coming	into	one’s	presence,	he	tells	you	to	depart,
Or	[if	one	dreams]	that	one	is	being	dragged	along	by	a	black	rope	attached	to
the	neck,
Or	that	one	is	inside	a	lofty	red-coloured	castle,
Surrounded	by	a	moat	and	perimeter	wall,
Or	[if	one	dreams]	of	being	decapitated	and	having	one’s	head	carried	off	by
another,
Or	of	being	surrounded	by	crows,	anguished	spirits,	or	villains,
Or	of	being	willingly	led	away,	or	leaving	[home]	in	a	bridal	procession,
Of	b

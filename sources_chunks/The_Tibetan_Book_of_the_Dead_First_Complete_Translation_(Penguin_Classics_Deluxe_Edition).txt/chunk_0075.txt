ration	 of	 Fear	 through	 the	 Ritual
Deception	of	Death
	should	be	undertaken	without	delay.
The	sophisticated	description	of	the	process	of	dying,	contained	in	the
section	‘Signs	of	Extremely	Near	Death’,	concurs	with	the	understanding
of	the	process	of	death	commonly	found	in	classical	Buddhist	literature.
h
This	section	forms	a	component	of	the	
Liberation	by	Hearing
	(Chapter
11)	and	it	is	a	vital	aspect	of	the	guidance	to	be	given	by	a	qualified
spiritual	teacher	at	the	time	of	death.
The	predictive	signs	of	death,	however,	are	more	idiosyncratic	and
show	influences	from	Tibetan	folklore	and	traditional	medicine.	Further,
in	terms	of	the	predictive	signs	of	death,	it	is	said	that	the	
subtler	signs

described	 here	 can	 only	 be	 accurately	 recognised	 by	 those	 who	 are
continuously	engaged	in	meditative	practice.
The	elicitation	and	analysis	of	the	predictive	signs	is	not	a	common
practice	today,	except,	in	the	case	of	certain	signs,	in	the	context	of
traditional	 medicine.	 Nonetheless,	 this	 text	 demonstrates	 a	 powerful
sensitivity	 to	 impermanence	 and	 a	 sustained	 sensitivity	 to	 one’s
immediate	experience.

INTRODUCTION
Alas!	This	illusory	and	feeble	aggregate	of	form,
Created	from	compounded	past	actions	and	conditions,
Like	[the	flame	of]	a	butter	lamp	blowing	in	the	wind,	cannot	last	for	ever.
4
Nothing	at	all	exists	which	is	not	subject	to	the	conditioning	of	death,
And	indeed,	since	it	is	uncertain	when	death	will	occur,
One	should	constantly	be	cognisant	of	the	signs	of	[impending]	death,
And	strive	after	[the	accumulation	of]	virtue.
There	are	two	[primary]	conditions	responsible	for	the	death	of	human	beings:
[First]	untimely	death	and	[second]	death	due	to	the	[natural]	exhaustion	of

the	lifespan.
5
Untimely	or	sudden	death	may	be	averted,
By	successful	application	of	the	
Ritual	Deception	of	Death
,
6
But	death	due	to	the	[natural]	exhaustion	of	the	lifespan
Is	like	the	burning	out	of	a	butter	lamp,
So	there	is	no	way	of	averting	this	through	‘ritual	deception’,
And	thus,	[if	this	is	indicated],	one	should	make	preparations	to	depart.
In	either	case,	[however],	it	is	most	important	to	engage	in	the	following
analysis.
	
This	teaching	[on	the	visual	indications	and	signs	of	death]
Is	presented	in	terms	of	six	general	topics,	namely:
External,	internal,	and	secret	signs	of	death,
Signs	of	remote	death,	signs	of	near	death,
And,	lastly,	miscellaneous	signs	of	death.
	
When	investigating	[the	time	of]	death,
First	one	should	make	offerings
To	the	[visualised]	assemblies	of	spiritual	teachers,	meditational	deities	and
ḍākin
ῑ
s,
And	please	the	protectors	of	the	[sacred]	teachings	with	torma-offerings.
Then,	one	should	present	feast-offerings	to	one’s	fellow	practitioners,
And	also	engage	in	charitable	acts.
Then,	[the	signs	of]	death	should	be	examined	in	the	following	way.
EXTERNAL	SIGNS	OF	DEATH
First,	when	the	examination	of	external	[signs]	is	made,
It	is	the	bodily	characteristics	that	should	be	investigated,
Because	the	signs	of	death	will	arise	in	relation	to	these	[characteristics].
The	body	is	composed	of	the	four	elements,
Thus	the	following	portents	of	its	demise
Will	arise	prior	[to	the	time	of	death]:
Loss	of	appetite,	dullness	of	the	sense	faculties,
A	feeling	of	anger	which	consumes	body,	speech	and	mind,

Distracted	or	depresse

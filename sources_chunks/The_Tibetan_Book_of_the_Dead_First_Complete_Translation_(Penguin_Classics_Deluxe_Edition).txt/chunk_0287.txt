Two	Truths
	
bden-pa	gnyis
,	Skt.	
satyadvaya
All	Buddhist	philosophical	schools	of	thought	formulate	their	ontology	within
the	 framework	 of	 the	 two	 truths,	 the	 conventional	 or	 relative	 truth	 (Skt.
samvṛtisatya
,	 Tib.	
kun-rdzob	 bden-pa
)	 and	 the	 ultimate	 truth	 (Skt.
paramārthasatya
,	Tib.	
don-dam	bden-pa
).	However,	the	definition	of	the	two
truths	differs	according	to	their	different	epistemological	interpretations.	The
Cittamātra
	and	
Madhyamaka
,	the	two	
Greater	Vehicle
	schools	of	thought	which
emphasise	the	doctrine	of	the	two	truths,	define	the	ultimate	truth	as	a	synonym
of	
emptiness
,	the	ultimate	nature	of	phenomena,	while	the	conventional	truth	is
defined	as	the	empirical	aspect	of	reality	as	conventionally	experienced	through
our	 perceptions.	 Such	 an	 aspect	 of	 reality	 is	 true	 only	 within	 the	 relative
framework	of	our	own	veridical	experiences.	However,	according	to	the	various
tantra
	
vehicles
	there	are	increasing	degrees	of	subtlety	in	the	interpretation	of
the	two	truths.
	
Ubhayatantra
	
gnyis-ka’i	rgyud
Ubhayatantra
,	also	known	as	
Caryātantra
,	is	the	second	of	the	three	outer
classes	of	
tantra
,	which	form	one	subcategory	of	the	six	classes	of	
tantra
,	and
the	fifth	of	the	
nine	vehicles
,	according	to	the	
Nyingma
	school	of	Tibetan

Buddhism.	
Ubhayatantra
	
places	an	equal	emphasis	on	both	external	ritual	and
internal	meditation.

Universal	Monarch
	
khor-lo	bsgyur-ba
,	Skt.	
cakravartin
In	the	context	of	Indo-Tibetan	Buddhism,	the	concept	of	the	benign	universal
monarch	 or	 emperor	 who	 rules	 in	 accordance	 with	 the	 law	 of	 the	
sacred
teachings
	
of	Buddhism	is	one	that	has	permeated	Buddhist	literature	since	the
time	of	
Aśoka
.	Their	appearance	in	the	world	is	considered	a	unique	and	rare
event,	just	as	the	appearance	of	a	
buddha
	is	considered	to	be	unique	and	rare.
	
Unsurpassed	Yogatantra
	
bla-med	rgyud
,	Skt.	
Yoganiruttaratantra
The	highest	among	the	four	classes	of	
tantra
,	the	other	three	being:	
Kriyā
,
Caryā
,	and	
Yoga	tantra
.	The	differences	between	the	four	classes	of	
tantra
represent	 stages	 of	 ever-decreasing	 emphasis	 on	 external	 ritual	 and	 ever-
increasing	subtlety	of	internal	
meditation.
	
Niruttara
	means	‘unsurpassed’	or
‘highest’	and	it	is	in	
the	
Yoganiruttara	
tantras
	that	the	meditative	techniques	for
realising	the	
Three	buddha-bodies
	are	the	most	subtle	and	refined.	There	are
two	distinct	phases	in	the	dissemination	of	the	Unsurpassed	
Yogatantras
	in	Tibet,
which	are	reflected	in	two	differing	ways	of	classifying	them.	According	to	the
Nyingma
	school,	the	earlier	phase	of	dissemination,	they	are	classified	into
Mahāyoga
,	
Anuyoga
	and	
Atiyoga
,	whereas	the	later	schools	classify	them	into
Father,	Mother	and	Non-dual	or	Indivisible	
tantras
.

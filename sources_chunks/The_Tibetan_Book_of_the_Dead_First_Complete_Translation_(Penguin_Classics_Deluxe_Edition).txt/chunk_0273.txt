contemporary	 Buddhist	 lineages	 relating	 to	 the	
sūtras

Seal
	
phyag-rgya
,	Skt.	
mudrā
According	 to	 the	
sūtras
,	 the	 word	 ‘seal’	 denotes	 a	 secure	
realisation
	 of
emptiness
.	In	the	
tantras
	it	refers	to	the	various	hand-gestures	which	accompany
the	recitation	of	
mantras
,	and	by	extension	refers	also	to	the	
meditational
deity
’s	symbolic	hand-emblem	(
phyag-mtshan
)	-	the	
vajra
,	bell	and	so	forth.	In
this	context	therefore	the	seals	are	the	resonance	of	
buddha-body
.	Furthermore,
in	the	
Yogatantras
,	in	particular,	there	are	four	seals	which	secure	the	aspects	of
mundane	
consciousness
	
(
vijñāna
)	as	their	corresponding	aspects	of	
pristine
cognition
	(
jñāna
):	among	them,	the	
great	seal
	(
mahāmudrā
)	of	
buddha-body
secures	 the	
ground-of-all	 consciousness
	
(
ālayavijñāna
)	 as	 the	 mirror-like
pristine	 cognition
	 (
ādarśajñāna
);	 the	 seal	 of	 the	
sacred	 teachings
(
dharmamudrā
)	 of	
buddha-speech
	 secures	 the	 mental	 consciousness
(
manovijñāna
)	as	the	
pristine	cognition
	of	discernment	(
pratyavekṣaṇajñāna
);
the	seal	of	commitment	(
samayamudrā
)	of	
buddha-mind
	secures	the	deluded
consciousness	 (
kliṣṭamanovijñāna
)	 as	 the	
pristine	 cognition
	 of	 sameness
(
samatājñāna
)

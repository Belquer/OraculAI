Eight	Freedoms	and	Ten	Opportunities
	
dal-ba	brgyad	dang	’byor-ba	bcu
Birth	as	a	human	being	with	the	freedom	and	opportunity	to	follow	the	Buddhist
path	 is	 regarded	 as	 difficult	 to	 attain	 and	 a	 precious	 circumstance.	 In	 the
preliminary	practices
	of	the	
tantra
	path,	in	order	to	establish	an	appreciation
for	 the	 significance	 of	 human	 rebirth,	 the	 freedom	 one	 has	 from	 eight
unfavourable	rebirths	is	a	focus	of	contemplation,	together	with	contemplation
of	the	ten	favourable	opportunities.	The	eight	freedoms	are	the	freedoms	from
the	following	eight	states:	birth	in	the	
hells
,	birth	as	an	
anguished	spirit
,	birth	as
an	animal,	birth	as	an	uncivilised	or	barbarous	person,	birth	as	a	long-living	
god
,
birth	 into	 a	 society	 that	 holds	 mistaken	 beliefs,	 birth	 in	 an	 age	 devoid	 of
Buddhism,	 and	 birth	 with	 limited	 faculties.	 Among	 the	 ten	 favourable
opportunities,	there	are	five	which	are	personally	acquired	and	five	which	are
contingent	on	external	factors.	The	former	comprise	the	favourable	opportunities
of	being	born	as	a	human	being,	in	a	civilised	society,	with	perfect	sense-
faculties,	not	being	engaged	in	a	conflicting	lifestyle,	and	having	confidence	in
Buddhism.	The	latter	comprise	the	favourable	opportunities	of	being	born	in	an
aeon
	when	a	
buddha
	has	appeared,	when	the	sacred	teachings	have	been	taught,
when	they	are	still	being	practised,	and	when	one	actively	engages	in	their
practice,	and	finds	a	qualified	
spiritual	friend
	(

b],	then	you	must,	at	this	time,
meditate	on	Hayagr
ῑ
va.	Since	you	now	possess	a	subtle	supernormal	cognitive
ability,	you	will	[clearly]	apprehend	all	the	[potential]	birthplaces	as	they	arise,
in	sequence.	Therefore,	make	your	choice,	[based	on	the	examination	of	the
indications	 and	 based	 on	 the	 instructions]!	 There	 are	 two	 kinds	 of	 oral
instruction	 [which	 can	 now	 be	 applied]:	 [first],	 the	 oral	 instructions	 for
transferring	the	consciousness	to	the	pure	buddha	fields
36
	
and	[second],	the
instructions	 for	 choosing	 a	 womb	 entrance	 within	 impure	 cyclic	 existence.
Therefore,	[listen	carefully	and]	do	as	follows:
First,	the	transference	of	consciousness	to	the	utterly	pure	realms	of	the	sky-
farers	is	effected	by	those	of	highest	ability,	by	directing	their	intention	as
follows.	‘Alas!	I	am	deeply	sad	that	even	after	an	infinite	“incalculable	aeon”,	I
am	still	left	behind	in	this	swamp	of	cyclic	existence.	How	dreadful	it	is,	that
while	so	many	have	attained	buddhahood	in	the	past,	I	have	still	not	achieved

liberation.	Now,	this	cycle	of	existence	disgusts	me!	It	horrifies	me!	I	have	long
been	led	astray	by	it!	Now,	the	moment	approaches	for	me	to	move	forward!
Now,	I	must	take	birth,	miraculously,	in	the	bud	of	a	lotus	flower,	in	the	presence
of	the	Buddha	Amitābha,	in	the	western	Buddha	field	of	the	Blissful
	(
Sukhāvat
ῑ
)
!’
Focus	your	intention,	concentratedly,	on	this	thought!	[It	is	essential	that	you
make	this	effort!]	Alternatively,	you	can	focus	your	intention	on	whichever
buddha	 field	 you	 wish.	 On	 Manifest	 Joy
	 (
Abhirati
)
,	 on	 Dense	 Array
(
Ghanavyūha
)
,	on	Alakāvat
ῑ
,	on	Mount	Potālaka,	or	[you	may	wish	to	focus]	on
coming	into	the	presence	of	[Padmasambhava	of]	Oḍḍiyāna,	in	the	celestial
palace	of	Lotus	Light,	or	indeed	on	whichever	buddha	field	you	wish	to	enter.	Be
single-minded!	 Do	 not	 be	 distracted!	 Immediately	 upon	 establishing	 [this
intention],	 you	 will	 take	 birth	 in	 the	 [chosen]	 buddha	 field.	 Yet	 again,
alternatively,	if	you	wish	to	proceed	into	the	presence	of	Maitreya	in	[the	realm
of]	The	Joyful
	(
Tuṣita
)
,	think	as	follows:	‘At	this	juncture	in	the	intermediate
state,	the	moment	has	come	for	me	to	proceed	into	the	presence	of	the	king	of	the
[sacred]	teachings,	Maitreya,	in	[the	realm	of]	The	Joyful.	Therefore,	it	is	there
that	I	will	go!’	If	you	focus	your	intention	on	this	thought,	you	will	take	birth,
miraculously,	in	the	heart	of	a	lotus,	in	the	presence	of	Maitreya.
Alternatively,	if	you	are	unable	to	accomplish	this	[transference],	or	if	you
desire	to	enter	a	womb	or	you	are	obliged	to	enter	one,	then	there	are	the
following	 instructions	 on	 choosing	 a	 womb	 entrance	 within	 impure	 cyclic
existence.	 Therefore,	 listen	 [carefully].	 Utilising	 the	 supernormal	 cognitive
ability	 which	 you	 now	 possess,	 examine	 the	 continents	 once	 again,	 as	 just
described,	and	make	your	choice.	You	must	enter	a	land	where	the	[sacred]
teachings	flourish!
[Be	warned,	however!]	It	could	be	that,	[in	reality],	you	are	about	to	take
birth,	by	entering	into	a	substance	which	is	fetid	and	polluted,	and	yet	that	filthy
mass	will	be	perceived	by	you	as	sweet-smelling	and	you	will	be	drawn	towards
it	and	take	birth	within	it.	Therefore,	whatever	such	[attractive]	appearances
may	arise,	do	not	grasp	at	them	as	substantially	real!	Ensure	that	you	remain
utterly	free	from	the	symptoms	of	attachment	and	aversion,	and	on	that	basis
choose	an	excellent	womb	entrance.
It	is	extremely	important	that	your	motivation	is	firmly	concentrated	[as	you
approach	the	womb	entrance].	Therefore	think	as	
follows:	‘Ah!	For	the	sake	of
all	sentient	beings,	I	shall	be	born	as	a	universal	monarch,	or	[acting	purely]
like	a	great	[dignified]	sal	tree,	I	shall	be	born	into	the	brāhman	class,	or	as	the
child	 of	 an	 accomplished	 master,	 or	 into	 a	 family	 which	 maintains	 an

immaculate	lineage	of	the	[sacred]	teachings,	or	into	a	family	where	the	mother
and	fat

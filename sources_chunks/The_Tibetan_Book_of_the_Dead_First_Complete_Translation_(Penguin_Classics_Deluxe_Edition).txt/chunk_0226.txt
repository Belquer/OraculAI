Buddha	Field
	
zhings-khams
,	Skt.	
[buddha]kṣetra
The	operational	fields	or	‘paradises’	presided	over	by	specific	
buddhas
,	which
spontaneously	 arise	 as	 a	 result	 of	 their	 altruistic	 aspirations,	 are	 known	 as
buddha	fields.	Such	environments	are	totally	free	from	
suffering
,	both	physical
and	mental,	and	they	transcend	the	mundane	
god
	realms	(
devaloka
)	inhabited	by
sentient	beings
	
of	the	
world-systems
	of	desire,	form,	and	formlessness.	It	is
said	that	when	sentient	beings	who	have	not	yet	been	permanently	released	from
the	bondage	of	
cyclic	existence
	have	an	affinity	with	a	specific	
buddha
	and	are
consequently	born	into	a	respective	pure	realm,	they	become	temporarily	free
not	only	from	manifest	
sufferings
	
of	the	body	and	
mind
	but	also	from	the
pervasive	 sufferings	 of	 past	 conditioning.	 Such	 fields	 or	 pure	 realms	 are
regarded	as	conducive	to	the	continuing	cultivation	of	the	path	to	
buddhahood
.

	
Buiddhahood
	
sangs-rgyas	nyid	/	sangs-rgyas-kyi	go-phang

buddhapada
The	attainment	of	a	
buddha
,	who	has	not	only	gained	total	freedom	from
karmically	conditioned	existence	and	overcome	all	the	tendencies	imprinted	on
the	
mind
	as	a	result	of	a	long	association	with	
dissonant	mental	states,
	but	also
fully	 realised	 or	 manifested	 all	 aspects	 of

Buddha-mind
	
thugs
,	Skt.	
citta
The	term	buddha-mind	is	synonymous	with	
pristine	cognition
	(	
jñāna
),	five
modes	of	which	are	differentiated.	See	
Pristine	Cognition
.	In	the	particular
literature	of	the	
Nyingma
	school,	these	five	modes	are	distinctively	known	as
manifest	 enlightenment	 (
mngon-byang-gi	 thugs
),	 indivisible	 indestructible
reality	(
mi-phyed	rdo-rje’i	thugs
),	great	sameness	(
mnyam-pa	chen-po’i	thugs
),
great	 non-discursiveness	 (
mi-rtog	 chen-po’i	 thugs
),	 and	 liberator	 of	 sentient
beings	(
’gro-ba’i	sgrol-ba’i	thugs
).
	
Buddha	Nature
	
rigs
,	Skt.	
gotra
The	seed	of	
enlightenment
	inherent	within	the	mental	continuum	of	all	sentient
beings.	It	is	this	potential	which	makes	it	possible	for	every	individual	to	realise
the	ultimate	nature,	given	the	application	of	appropriate	methods.	The	notion	of
buddha	nature	is	intimately	linked	with	the	Buddhist	concept	of	the	essential
nature	of	
mind
,	which	according	to	Buddhism	is	considered	to	be	pure,	knowing
and	luminous.	
Dissonant	 mental	 states
	such	as	
attaahment
,	
aversion
	 and
jealousy,	which	perpetually	afflict	our	mind	and	give	rise	to	
suffering
,	are	not
the	essential	elements	of	our	
mind
	but	adventitious	and	conditioned	tendencies.
Moreover,	these	dissonant	states	are	all	rooted	in	an	ignorant	state	of	mind	which
misapprehends	 the	 true	 nature	 of	
reality
.	 Hence,	 through	 gaining	 genuine
insights	into	the	true	nature	of	
reality
,	misconceptions	can	be	dispelled,	thus
cutting	the	root	of	all	our	
dissonant	mental	states
	and	allowing	the	buddha-
nature	 within	 to	 manifest.	 The	 term	 ‘
nucleus	 of	 the
	
tathāgata
’
(
tathāgatagarbha
)	is	a	synonym	for	this	essence	of	
buddhahood
.
	
Buddha-speech
	
gsung
,	Skt.	
vāk
The	speech	of	the	
buddhas
	is,	according	to	
Nyingma
	literature,	said	to	have	five
aspects	in	that	the	
buddhas
	may	communicate	through	1)	uncreated	meaning

(
skye-med	don-gi	gsung
),	2)	
enlightened	intention
	and	symbols	(
dgongs-pa
brda’i	gsung
),	3)	expressive	words	(
brjod-pa	 tshig-gi	 gsung
),	 4)	 indivisible
reality	(
dbyer-med	rdo-rje’i	gsung
),	and	5	)	the	
blessings
	of	
awareness
	(
rig-pa
byin-labs-kyi	gsung
).	See

Burnt	Offerings
	
sbying-sreg
,	Skt.	
homa
A	
tantric	ritual
in	which	many	substances,	such	as	wheat,	sesame	seeds,	and
mustard,	etc.,	are	burnt	as	offerings	in	a	fire	lit	on	a	specifically	designed	hearth.
There	are	different	types	of	burnt-offering	ritua

offering,
such	as	the	recitation	of	songs	of	praise,	or	a	mental	offering,	such	as	the
offering	of	the	positive	potentials	which	one	may	have	accumulated	as	a	result	of
having	engaged	in	wholesome	deeds	beneficial	to	others.	More	specifically,	the
tantras
	
identify	four	kinds	of	offering	which	are	to	be	made,	namely,	outer,
inner,	secret	and	definitive	offerings.	The	outer	offerings	of	enjoyment	(
phyi
nyer-spyod-kyi	 mchod-pa
)	 are	 the	 eight	 associated	 with	 the	 eight	 offering
goddesses,	including	water	for	the	mouth,	water	for	the	feet,	flowers,	incense,
light,	perfume,	food,	and	sound,	as	well	as	song,	dance,	and	meditation.	Inner
offerings	 of	 commitment	 (
nang	 dam-rdzas-kyi	 mchod-pa
)	 refer	 to	 the	 pure
essences	of	semen,	blood	and	flesh,	transformed	through	the	
yoga
	of	the	
energy
channels
,	currents	and	
seminal	points
	
within	the	
subtile	body
.	Secret	offerings
are	those	of	sexual	union	and	‘liberation’	(
gsang-ba	sbyor-sgrol-gyi	mchod-pa
)
related	to	the	esoteric	rites	and	practices	which	transform	the	
five	poisons
	into
the	five	
pristine	cognitions
,	and	definitive	offerings	are	those	of	great	sameness
(
de-kho-na-nyid	mnyam-pa	chen-po’i	mchod-pa
),	namely	the	union	of	bliss	and
emptiness
.
	
Omniscience
	
thams-cad	mkhyen-pa-nyid
,	Skt.	
sarvajñatā
In	a	Buddhist	context	the	word	is	reserved	only	for	the	all-knowing	
pristine
cognition
	
of	the	
buddhas
.	Although	the	original	Sanskrit	and	Tibetan	terms,	like
their	 English	 equivalent,	 do	 carry	 with	 them	 the	 literal	 connotation	 of	 all-
knowingness,	the	principal	meaning	of	the	term	should	be	understood	in	terms	of
a	direct	and	simultaneous	perception	of	the	dual	aspects	of	
reality
,	
i.e.
	of	the
phenomenal	aspects	(valid	only	within	the	relative	framework	of	our	ordinary
perceptions)	and	their	ultimate	nature,	
emptiness
.	In	other	words	the	term	refers
primarily	to	a	non-conceptual	simultaneous	perception	of	the	
two	truths
	within
a	single	mental	act.

Padmasambhava
,	also	generally	known	as

	and	
Padmākara
,	is
revered	as	the	master	from	
Oddiyāna
	who,	along	with	
Sāntarakṣita
	and	King
Trisong	 Detsen
,	 formally	 established	 Buddhism	 in	 Tibet	 during	 the	 eighth
century.	In	particular,	he	is	renowned	for	his	suppression	and	conversion	of
malevolent	
spirits	and	hostile	non-Buddhist	forces,	as	well	as	for	introducing	to
Tibet	many	oral	transmissions	and	texts	of	
Mahāyoga
	and	
Atiyoga
,	including	the
teachings	contained	in	our	text,	the	
Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities:	Natural
Liberation	through	[Recognition	of]	Enlightened	Intention
	(
Zhi-khro	dgongs-pa

).	To	practitioners	of	the	
Nyingma
	school,	and	all	those	who	follow	the
practices	of	the	
Nyingma
	
lineages
,	he	is	revered	as	a	‘second	
buddha
’,	and
there	are	many	systems	of	meditation	based	on	the	visualisation	of	his	rainbow-
like	form.	Tibetan	literature	contains	a	number	of	biographical	accounts,	which
describe	his	life	in	the	form	of	eight	or	twelve	different	manifestations.	See

ere.
Look	at	your	own	mind	to	see	whether	it	is	like	that	or	not!
	
Be	certain	that	all	that	appears	is	naturally	manifest	[in	the	mind],
Like	the	images	in	a	mirror	which	[also]	appear	naturally.
Look	at	your	own	mind	to	see	whether	it	is	like	that	or	not!
Be	certain	that	all	characteristics	are	liberated	right	where	they	are,
Like	 the	 clouds	 of	 the	 atmosphere,	 naturally	 originating	 and	 naturally
dissolving.
Look	at	your	own	mind	to	see	whether	it	is	like	that	or	not!
	
There	are	no	phenomena	extraneous	to	those	that	originate	from	the	mind.
[So],	how	could	there	be	anything	on	which	to	meditate	apart	from	the	mind?
There	are	no	phenomena	extraneous	to	those	that	originate	from	the	mind.
[So],	there	are	no	modes	of	conduct	to	be	undertaken	extraneous	[to	those	that
originate	from	the	mind].
There	are	no	phenomena	extraneous	to	those	that	originate	from	the	mind.
[So],	there	are	no	commitments	to	be	kept	extraneous	[to	those	that	originate
from	the	mind].
There	are	no	phenomena	extraneous	to	those	that	originate	from	the	mind.
[So],	there	are	no	results	to	be	attained	extraneous	[to	those	that	originate	from
the	mind].

There	are	no	phenomena	extraneous	to	those	that	originate	from	the	mind.
[So],	one	should	observe	one’s	own	mind,	looking	into	its	nature	again	and
again.
	
If,	upon	looking	outwards	towards	the	external	expanse	of	the	sky,
There	are	no	projections	emanated	by	the	mind,
And	if,	on	looking	inwards	at	one’s	own	mind,
There	is	no	projectionist	who	projects	[thoughts]	by	thinking	them,
Then,	one’s	own	mind,	completely	free	from	conceptual	projections,	will
become	luminously	clear.
[This]	intrinsic	awareness,	[union	of]	inner	radiance	and	emptiness,	is	the
Buddha-body	of	Reality,
[Appearing]	like	[the	illumining	effect	of]	a	sunrise	on	a	clear	and	cloudless
sky,
It	is	clearly	knowable,	despite	its	lack	of	specific	shape	or	form.
There	is	a	great	distinction	between	those	who	understand	and	those	who
misunderstand	this	point.
	
This	naturally	originating	inner	radiance,	uncreated	from	the	very	beginning,
Is	the	parentless	child	of	awareness	—	how	amazing!
It	is	the	naturally	originating	pristine	cognition,	uncreated	by	anyone	—	how
amazing!
[This	radiant	awareness]	has	never	been	born	and	will	never	die	—	how
amazing!
Though	 manifestly	 radiant,	 it	 lacks	 an	 [extraneous]	 perceiver	 —	 how
amazing!
Though	it	has	roamed	throughout	cyclic	existence,	it	does	not	degenerate	—
how	amazing!
Though	it	has	seen	buddhahood	itself,	it	does	not	improve	—	how	amazing!
Though	it	is	present	in	everyone,	it	remains	unrecognised	—	how	amazing!
Still,	one	hopes	for	some	attainment	other	than	this	—	how	amazing!
Though	it	is	present	within	oneself,	one	continues	to	seek	it	elsewhere	—	how
amazing!
[INTRINSIC	AWARENESS	AS	VIEW,	MEDITATION,
CONDUCT,	AND	RESULT]

EMA!	This	immediate	awareness,	insubstantial	and	radiant,
Is	itself	the	highest	of	all	views.
This	non-referential,	all-encompassing	[awareness]	which	is	free	in	every
respect
Is	itself	the	highest	of	all	meditations.
This	uncontrived	[activity	based	on	awareness],	simply	expressed	in	worldly
terms,
Is	itself	the	highest	of	all	types	of	conduct.
This	 unsought	 [attainment	 of	 awareness],	 spontaneously	 present	 from	 the
beginning,
Is	itself	the	highest	of	all	results.
[Now],	the	four	great	media,	which	are	errorless,	are	presented:
14
[First],	the	great	medium	of	errorless	view
Is	this	radiant	immediate	awareness	—
Since	it	is	radiant	and	without	error,	it	is	called	a	‘medium’.
[Second],	the	great	medium	of	errorless	meditation
Is	this	radiant	immediate	awareness	—
Since	it	is	radiant	and	without	error,	it	is	called	a	‘medium’.
[Third],	the	great	medium	of	errorless	conduct
Is	this	radiant	immediate	awareness	—
Since	it	is	radiant	and	without	error,	it	is	called	a	‘medium’.
[Fourth],	the	great	medium	of	errorless	result
Is	this	radiant	immediate	awareness	—
Since	it	is	radiant	and	without	error,	it	is	called	a	‘medium’.
	
[Now]	the	four	great	nails,	which	are	un

Mistaken	views	(

connection	between	virtuous	causes	and	virtuous	effects,	and	those	which
ascribe	inherent	existence	in	varying	degrees	to	physical	and	mental	phenomena.

Vajrāsana,	the	‘indestructible	seat’	below	the	Bodhi	Tree	at	present-day	Bodh

The	miraculous	ability	based	on	past	actions	(
las-kyi	rdzu-’phrul
	)	is	an
intensified	perceptual	state	arising	from	past	habitual	tendencies	(
vāsanā
),	quite
distinct	from	the	four	supports	for	miraculous	ability	(
ṛddhipāda
)	or	enlightened
attributes	(
guṇa
)	indicative	of	buddhahood,	on	which	see	NSTB,	Vol.	2,	p.	138.

This	‘pure	clairvoyance’	(
lha-mig	dag-pa
),	like	the	miraculous	ability	based
on	past	actions	(
las-kyi	rdzu-’phrul
	)	described	above,	is	a	product	of	the
intensified	perception	of	the	mental	body,	enabling	those	destined	to	one	form	of
rebirth	to	perceive	beings	of	their	own	kind.	As	such,	it	is	differentiated	from	the
clairvoyance	possessed	by	the	gods	inhabiting	the	world-systems	of	form
(
rūpadhātu
)	and	desire	(
kāmadhātu
),	but	similar	to	that	which	is	acquired	in	the
course	of	meditation.

The	carnivorous	ogres	(Tib.	
srin-po
),	acting	as	the	executors	of	the	unfailing
law	of	cause	and	effect	(
las-kyi	sha-za
),	are	those	who	execute	the	rites	of	Yama
(
gshin-rje’i	las
).	See	Ch.	13,	pp.	321ff.

The	colours	of	the	three	precipices	symbolic	of	the	dissonant	mental	states

(

enlightened	families	(
rigs-gsum
)	through	which	they	are	purified,	
i.e.
	those	of
Akṣobhya,	who	is	the	natural	purity	of	aversion,	Amitābha,	who	is	the	natural
purity	of	attachment,	and	Vairocana,	who	is	the	natural	purity	of	delusion.	See

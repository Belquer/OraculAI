on	 twenty-one	 enlightened	 activities	 of	 the
buddhas
.	With	respect	to	the	historical	
Buddha	Sākyamuni
,	the	Buddhist	texts
list	twelve	principal	deeds	that	exemplify	his	enlightened	activities.	These	are	in
succession:	1)	the	descent	from	the	celestial	realm	of	
Tuṣita
,	2)	the	entry	into	the
womb,	3	)	birth,	4)	displaying	mastery	in	worldly	arts	and	skills,	5)	enjoying	the
women	of	the	harem,	6)	renouncing	the	worldly	way	of	life,	7)	undergoing
severe	physical	penances,	8)	meditating	under	the	tree	of	enlightenment,	9)
overcoming	beguiling	and	
malevolent	forces
,	10)	attaining	manifestly	perfect
buddhahood
,	1	1	)	
turning	the	wheel	of	the	sacred	teachings
	
,	and	12)
entering	the	peaceful	state	of	
fnal
	
nirvāṇa
.	In	terms	of	
skilful	means
,	buddha-
activity	 may	 be	 focused	 through	 four	 modalities:	 pacification,	 enrichment,
subjugation,	and	wrathful	transformation.	See	
Four	Aspects	of	Enlightened
Activity
.	Finally,	according	to	the	literature	of	the	
Nyingma
	school,	there	is	an

enumeration	of	five	modes	of	buddha-activity	when	spontaneous	or	effortless
activity	is	included	along	with	these	modalities.
	
Buddha-attributes
	
yon-tan
,	Skt.	
guṇa
The	attributes	of	a	
buddha
	may	be	subsumed	as	specific	qualities	of	
buddha-
body
,	
spech
	and	
mind
.	The	attributes	of	
buddha-body
	are	those	associated	with
the	 various	 ‘dimensions’	 of	
buddha-body
,	 described	 below,	 and	 more
specifically	with	the	
thirty-two	major	and	eighty	minor	marks.
	Those	of
buddha-speech
	are	known	as	the	‘sixty	melodies	of	
Brahmā
’,	which	implies
that	
buddha-speech
	is	soothing,	gentle,	firm,	audible	from	a	great	distance,	and
so	 forth.	 The	 attributes	 of	
buddha-mind
	
are	 threefold:	
compassion
,
omniscience
,	 and	
power
.	 Furthermore,	 in	 the	 literature	 of	 the	
tantras
,	 a
classification	of	five	resultant	enlightened	attributes	is	given,	namely:	the	pure
buddha	field
,	the	dimensionless	
celestial	palace
,	the	radiant	and	pure	rays	of
light,	the	exalted	thrones	of	the	deities,	and	the	possession	of	consummate
resources.
	
Buddha-body

The	term	‘buddha-body’	refers	not	only	to	the	physical	body	of	a	
buddha
,	but
also	to	the	varying	‘dimensions’	in	which	the	embodiment	of	fully	enlightened
attributes	is	present.	As	such,	the	buddha-body	can	be	categorised	in	different
ways,	corresponding	to	the	different	levels	of	the	teaching.	For	example,	
sūtras
of	 the	
Lesser	 Vehicle
	 (
h
ῑ
nayāna
)	 speak	 of	 the	
Buddha-body	 ofReality
(
dharmakāya
)	and	the	
Buddha-body	of	Form
	(
rūpakāya
),	while	
sūtras
	of	the
Greater	Vehicle
	(
mahāyāna
)	generally	mention	three	buddha-bodies	(
trikāya
),
dividing	the	latter	into	the	
Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource
	(
sambhogakāya
)
and	the	
Buddha-bodyof	Emanation
	
(
nirmāṇakāya
).	See	below.	In	the	
sūtras
and	treatises	expounding	
buddha-nature
	
(
tathāgatagarbha
),	such	as	
Maitreya
’s
Supreme	Continuum	of	the	Greater	Vehicle
	(
Mahayanottaratantraśāstra
),	 an
enumeration	 of	
four	 buddha-bodies	 (
catuḥkāya
)	 is	 mentioned.	 Here,	 the
Buddha-body	 of	 Essentiality	 (
svabhāvikakāya
)	 is	 added	 to	 the	 above	 three
buddha-bodies,	to	indicate	either	an	active/passive	distinction	in	the	
Buddha-
body	of	Reality
,	or	the	underlying	indivisible	essence	of	the	three	buddha-
bodies.	In	the	
tantras
	of	the	
Nyingma
	school,	there	is	an	enumeration	of	
five
buddha-bodies
	 (
pañcakāya
)	 where	 the	 Buddha-body	 of	 Awakening
(
abhisambodhikāya
,	Tib.	
mngon-byang-gi	sku
)	refers	to	the	apparitional	modes
of	 the	 three	 buddha-bodies,	 and	 the	 Buddha-body	 of	 Indestructible	 Reality

(
vajrakāya
,	Tib.	
rdo-rje’i	sku
)	refers	to	their	indivisible	essence.	Finally,	in
Atiyoga
,	when	the	buddha-bodies	are	actualised,	the	
Buddha-body	of	Reality
	is
known	as	the	youthful	vase	body	(
gzhon-nu’i	’bum-pa’i	sku
)	and	the	
Buddha-
bodyt	of	Form
	is	known	as	the	body	of	great	transformation	(
’pho-ba	chen-po’i
sku
).

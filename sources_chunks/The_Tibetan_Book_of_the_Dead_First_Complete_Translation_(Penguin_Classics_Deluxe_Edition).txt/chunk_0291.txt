	(

Vital	Energy
	
rlung
,	Skt.	
vāyu
In	the	
tantras
	and	related	medical	traditions,	it	is	said	that	there	are	ten	kinds	of
vital	energy	or	subtle	winds	which	flow	through	the	72,000	
energy	channels
(Skt.	
nāḍ
ῑ
)	of	the	body.	These	sustain	life	and	include	the	energies	which	support
various	conceptual	states	within	the	individual’s	mind.	At	the	subtlest	level,
subtle	mind	and	vital	energy	are	thought	of	as	a	single	entity.	The	ten	kinds	of
vital	 energy	 comprise:	 five	 inner	 vital	 energies	 (
nang-gi	rlung	lnga
)	 which
influence	the	body’s	inner	motility,	and	five	outer	vital	energies	(
phyi-’i	rlung
lnga
)	which	have	specific	effects	on	the	outward	motility	of	the	body.	The
former	are	the	vital	energies	associated	with	the	
five	elements
	(earth,	water,	fire,
wind,	space)	and	their	respective	colour-tones	(yellow,	white,	red,	green,	blue).
The	latter	comprise	life-breath	(Skt.	
prāṇa
,	Tib.	
srog-’dzin
),	muscular	movement
(Skt.	
vyāna
),	digestion	(Skt.	
samāna
),	semiotic/vocal	movement	(Skt.	
udāna
),
and	reproduction/waste	disposal	(Skt.	
apāna
).	The	movement	of	vital	energy
through	the	
energy	channels
	of	the	
subtle	body
	is	refined	in	the	context	of	the

perfection	stage
	of	meditation.	Ordinarily,	in	the	case	of	individuals	who	have
not	cultivated	such	practices,	both	vital	energy	and	subtle	mind	are	diffused	via
the	right	and	left	
energy	channels
	and	thereby	come	to	permeate	the	entire
network	of	the	body’s	minor	channels.	This	dissipated	vital	energy	is	known	as
the	 vital	 energy	 of	 past	 actions	 (
las-kyi	 rlung
)	 because	 it	 is	 activated	 by
dissonant	 mental	 states
,	 and	 the	 influence	 of	
past	 actions
	 predominates,
obscuring	the	
inner	radiance
	of	the	subtle	mind.	However,	when	the	practices
of	the	
perfection	stage
	of	meditation	are	applied,	the	knots	which	block	their
combined	movement	through	the	
energy	centres
	(Skt.	
cakra
)	located	on	the
central	
energy	channel
	are	untied	and	both	vital	energy	and	subtle	mind	enter,
abide	and	dissolve	within	the	central	
energy	channel
	of	the	body	(Skt.	
avadhūti
)
and	then	the	non-conceptual	
inner	radiance
	arises,	for	which	reason	it	becomes
known	as	the	
vital	energy
	of	
pristine	cognition
	(
ye-shes-kyi	 rlung
).	 On	 a
physical	level,	it	is	important,	
according	to	the	Tibetan	medical	tradition,	that
vital	energy	remains	in	balance	with	bile	and	phlegm,	which	are	collectively
known	as	the	three	humours,	if	sound	health	is	to	be	maintained.
	
Vows	[of	Buddhism]
	
sdom-pa
,	Skt.	
saṃvara
Sets	of	precepts	or	injunctions	voluntarily	adopted	in	the	course	of	Buddhist
practice	which	facilitate	an	individual’s	progress	on	the	path	to	
enlightenment
.
These	include	short-term	vows,	such	as	the	one-day	vows,	lifelong	vows,	such	as
the	 monastic	 vows	 of	 a	 fully	 ordained	 monk	 or	 nun,	 and	 perpetual	 vows
associated	 with	 the	
Greater	 Vehicle
,	 which	 are	 to	 be	 maintained	 over	 a
succession	of	lifetimes.	All	such	vows	may	be	subsumed	within	three	categories:
the	monastic	vows	of	the	
prātimokṣa
,	the	special	vows	of	the	
bodhisattvas
,	and
the	 special	
commitments
	
(Skt.	
samaya
)	 undertaken	 by	 practitioners	 of	 the
tantras
.	 See	
Prātimokṣa
	 and	
Commitment
.	 The	 special	 vows	 of	 the
bodhisattvas
,	exemplified	by	the	
Sūtra	of	Ākāśagarbha
,	extol	that	
bodhisattvas
must	be	careful	to	maintain	their	altruistic	vows,	expressed	in	the	verses	of	the
four	immeasurable	aspirations
,	and	to	avoid	nineteen	specifically	enumerated
root	
downfalls
	(Skt.	
mūlāpatti
)	and	forty-six	
transgressions
	
(Skt.	
duṣkṛta
).	In
all	schools	of	Tibetan	Buddhism,	the	
prātimokṣa
	and	
bodhisattva
	vows	and	the
commitments
	of	the	
tantras
	are	fully	integrated.

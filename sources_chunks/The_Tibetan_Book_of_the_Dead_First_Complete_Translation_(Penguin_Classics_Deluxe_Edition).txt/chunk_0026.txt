[as	they	arise]	from	their	pure	abodes,
And	bestow	accomplishments	upon	those	who	keep	their	commitments.
	
Secret	Refuge
	
From	within	a	state	free	from	grasping	and	beyond	intellect,
I	take	refuge	in	the	nature	of	the	great	expanse	of	sameness	and	perfection,
11
Atemporal	emptiness,	free	from	conceptual	elaboration,
Primordially	pure	in	essence,	natural	expression	and	compassionate	energy.
	
From	within	[a	state	which	is]	non-conceptual,	naturally	radiant	and	stark,
I	take	refuge	in	the	primordial	embodiment	of	the	five	buddha-bodies,
Spontaneously	and	naturally	present,
[Abiding]	in	the	maṇḍala	of	the	[unique]	seminal	point,
Which	 is	 [the	 union	 of]	 expanse	 and	 awareness,	 and	 of	 radiance	 and
emptiness,
The	indestructible	chain	of	inner	radiance,	that	is	intrinsic	awareness.
	
Throughout	the	three	times,	beginningless	and	endless,
I	take	refuge	in	the	Compassionate	Ones,
Unimpeded,	naturally	expressive,	and	all-pervasive,
The	unimpededly	arising	and	subsiding	rays	of	light,
Which	emanate	through	the	expressive	power	of	awareness,
Dispelling,	non-conceptually,	the	darkness	in	the	minds	of	living	beings.

The	Generation	of	an	Altruistic	Intention
(Then,	the	altruistic	intention	of	the	Greater	Vehicle	should	be	generated	in	the
following	way:)
	
Even	though	all	phenomena	are	empty	and	selfless,
Sentient	beings	fail	to	realise	this.	Alas!	How	needing	of	compassion	are	they!
So	 that	 all	 those	 who	 are	 the	 focus	 of	 our	 compassion	 may	 attain
enlightenment,
I	must	rouse	my	body,	speech	and	mind	to	[the	practice	of]	virtue!
	
For	the	benefit	of	all	sentient	beings	of	the	six	classes,
From	now	until	enlightenment	is	attained,
Not	just	for	my	own	sake	but	for	the	benefit	of	all,
I	must	generate	the	mind	[aspiring]	to	supreme	enlightenment!
	
How	needing	of	compassion	are	those	bereft	of	the	[sacred]	teachings,
Who	have	ensnared	themselves	within	the	unfathomable	ocean	of	suffering.
So	that	all	those	who	are	the	focus	of	our	compassion	may	be	established	in
happiness,
I	must	generate	the	mind	[aspiring]	to	supreme	enlightenment!
	
I	myself	and	all	infinite	sentient	beings
Are	primordially	of	the	nature	of	buddhahood.
So	that	we	may	[all]	become	supreme	embodiments,	who	know	this	to	be	so,
I	must	generate	the	mind	[aspiring]	to	supreme	enlightenment!
	
The	ocean	of	mundane	cyclic	existence	is	like	an	illusion.
All	compounded	things	lack	permanence.
Their	essence	is	empty	and	selfless,
But	these	naive	beings	[right	here]	who	do	not	realise	this	to	be	so
Roam	through	cyclic	existence,	[driven	on]	by	the	twelve	links	of	dependent
origination.
So	that	all	beings	gripped	in	this	quagmire	of	name	and	form	may	attain
buddhahood,
12
I	must	rouse	my	body,	speech,	and	mind	to	[the	practice	of]	virtue!

	
I	take	refuge	[from	now]	until	enlightenment,
In	the	Buddha,	the	[sacred]	teachings	and	supreme	assembly.
Through	the	merit	of	practising	generosity	and	the	other	[perfections],
May	I	attain	buddhahood	for	the	sake	of	[all]	living	beings!
May	I	become	a	spiritual	teacher,	[able	to]	guide	infinite	sentient	beings,
As	many	as	there	are,	without	exception!
	
(Then,	one	should	meditate	on	the	four	immeasurable	aspirations	as	follows:)
	
May	all	sentient	beings	be	endowed	with	happiness!
May	they	all	be	separated	from	suffering	and	its	causes!
May	they	be	endowed	with	joy,	free	from	suffering!
May	they	abide	in	equanimity,	free	from	attachment	or	aversion!
Purification	of	Negativity	and	Obscuration	through	the	Repeated	Recitation
of	the	Hundred-syllable	Mantra	[of	Vajrasattva]
(This	should	be	done	in	the	context	of	the	following	visualisation:)
	
At	the	crown	of	my	head,	on	a	lotus	moon	cushion,
Is	my	spiritual	teacher,	[resplendent]	in	the	form	of	Vajrasattva.
His	body	is	translucent,	like	crystal,	and	at	his	heart,
[Resting]	on	a	moon-disc,	is	a	syllable	HŪṂ,	surrounded	by	the	Hundred-
syllable	Mantra.
13
A	stream	of	nectar	then	descends	through	my	crown	fontanelle,
14
Purifying	 my	 violations	 [of	 the	 commitments],	 my	 nega

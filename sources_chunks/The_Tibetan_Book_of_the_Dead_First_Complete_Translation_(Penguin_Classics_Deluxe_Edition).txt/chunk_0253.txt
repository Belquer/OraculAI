Lake-dwelling	Medicinal	Spirits
	
mtsho-sman/’tsho-sman
A	group	of	five,	seven	or	nine	female	spirits	of	the	
sman-mo
	class	who	dwell	in
lakes,	and	who	are	differentiated	from	the	sky-dwelling	medicinal	spirits	(
nam-
mkha’i	sman-mo
),	the	earth-dwelling	medicinal	spirits	(
sa’i	sman-mo
),	and	the
hybrid	serpentine-medicinal	spirits	(
klu-sman
).	In	general,	the	
sman-mo
	are	a
category	
of	 indigenous	 Tibetan	 spirits,	 to	 whom	 medicinal	
torma-
offerings

(
sman-gtor
),	compounded	of	medicines,	nectars	and	blood,	are	made.	Foremost
among	them	are	the	five	sisters	of	longevity	(
tshe-ring	mched-lnga
),	who	are
embodied	in	the	five	main	snow	peaks	of	the	Everest	range.	The	most	powerful
of	these	medicinal	spirits	are	said	to	have	been	bound	under	an	oath	of	allegiance
by	
Padmasambhava
	at	Silma	in	Tsang.

‘Liberating’	Avengers
	
sgrol-ging
This	is	the	name	of	a	class	of	male	sword-wielding	spirits,	collectively	known	as
the	
skyes-bu	ging-chen
,	who	are	invoked	in	order	to	enact	the	wrathful	
rites	of
‘liberation
’.
	
Liberation
	
grol-ba/sgrol-ba
,	Skt.	
mokṣa
In	a	Buddhist	context,	the	term	liberation	refers	specifically	to	freedom	from
cyclic	existence
,	the	karmically	conditioned	cycle	of	death	and	rebirth,	and
consequently	to	freedom	from	all	forms	of	physical	and	mental	
suffering
.	Such
a	liberation	can	be	attained	only	through	the	total	elimination	of	
fundamental
ignorance
	 and	 the	
dissonant	 mental	 states
,	 including	
attachment
	 and
aversion
,	which	afflict	the	mind	and	perpetuate	the	cycle	of	existence.
	
Lifelong	Companion	Gods
	
’go-ba’i	lha
This	is	a	category	of	spirits	who	are	said	to	accompany	an	individual	throughout
his	or	her	life,	like	a	shadow,	protecting	the	vitality	(
bla
)	of	the	individual.	Five
types	of	lifelong	companion	god	(
’go-ba’i	lha	lnga
)	are	specifically	identified:
the	gods	of	the	life-essence	(
srog-gi-lha
),	the	gods	of	masculinity	(
pho-lha
),	the
gods	of	femininity	(
mo-lha
),	the	gods	of	the	countryside	(
yul-lha
),	and	the	gods
of	inimical	force	(
dgra-lha
).
	
Lineage
	
brgyud-pa
,	Skt.	
paraṃparā
An	unbroken	line	of	successive	teachers	through	whom	the	Buddhist	teachings
are	transmitted.	According	to	the	
Nyingma
	tradition,	six	forms	of	lineage	are

described:	1)	the	
intentional	lineage	of	the	conquerors
	(
rgyal-ba’i	dgongs-
brgyud
),	 through	 which	 the	
Buddha-body	 of	 Reality
	 communicates	 the
teachings	to	the	
Buiddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource
;	2)	the	
symbolic	lineage	of
awareness	holders
	(
rig-’dzin	brda’i	brgyud-pa
),	through	which	non-human	and
human	
awareness	 holders
	 of	 the	 highest	
spiritual	 accomplishements
symbolically	receive	the	teachings	from	
bodhisattvas
	of	the	tenth	level;	3)	the
aural	lineage	of	authoritative	personages	(
gang-zag	snyankhung-gi	brgyud-pa
),
through	which	
accomplished	masters
	orally	transmit	the	teachings	from	one
generation	to	the	next;	4)	the	lineage	empowered	by	enlightened	aspiration
(
smon-lam	dbang-bskur-gyi	brgyud-pa
),	 through	 which	 a	
treasure-finder
	
of
concealed	texts	is	identified	by	their	concealer’s	solemn	affirmation,	5	)	the
lineage	of	prophetically	declared	spiritual	succession	(
bka’-babs	lung-bstan-gyi
brgyud-pa
),	through	which	a	
treasure-fnder
	of	concealed	texts	is	identified
from	the	authoritative	prophesies	of	
Padmasambhava
,	and	6)	the	lineage	of	the
ḍākin
ῑ
’s	seal	of	entrustment	(
mkha’-’gro	gtad-rgya’i	brgyud-pa
	),	through	which
a	
treasure-finder
	is	
granted	codified	teachings	by	the	lords	of	the	
treasure
	in
fulfilment	of	the	concealer’s	former	aspiration.

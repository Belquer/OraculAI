O	you	whose	cognisance	and	knowledge	spans	[the	three]	times,
Since	you	are	sublime	beings,	embrace	us!
Since	we	are	sentient	beings,	we	are	flawed	and	bewildered,
And,	since	[this	separation]	is	an	illusion,	may	our	confession	be	granted!
Since	you	are	accomplished	in	skilful	means,	bestow	your	purity	upon	us!
	
Then	a	remorseful	confession	should	be	made	to	the	peaceful	deities	as	follows:
	
OṂ	Most	precious	Samantabhadra	[in	union],	supreme	buddha-mind,
Even	though	you	are	our	father	and	hold	mastery	over	the	three	world-
systems,
And	even	though	you	are	our	mother	and	assimilate	[all	things]	in	the	ultimate
expanse,
By	conceiving	of	our	bodies	[in	a	mundane	way],	we	have	dishonoured	the
illusory	body.
Thus	 our	 commitments	 have	 degenerated	 and	 we	 have	 grown	 truly
remorseful.
We	seek	your	forgiveness,	O	Samantabhadra	and	Samantabhadr
ῑ
,	mother	and
father!
	
Most	precious	buddhas	of	the	five	enlightened	families,	[manifestations	of]
supreme	buddha-mind,
Even	though	you	are	our	fathers	and	hold	mastery	over	the	three	world-
systems,
And	even	 though	 you	are	 our	 mothers	and	 assimilate	[all	 things]	 in	 the
ultimate	expanse,
By	conceiving	of	our	bodies	[in	a	mundane	way],	we	have	dishonoured	the
illusory	body.
Thus	 our	 commitments	 have	 degenerated	 and	 we	 have	 grown	 truly

remorseful.
We	 seek	 your	 forgiveness,	 O	 father	 and	 mother	 buddhas	 of	 the	 five
enlightened	families!
	
Most	precious	male	and	female	bodhisattvas,	[manifestations	of]	supreme
buddha-mind,
Even	though	you	are	our	fathers	and	hold	mastery	over	the	three	world-
systems,
And	even	 though	 you	are	 our	 mothers	and	 assimilate	[all	 things]	 in	 the
ultimate	expanse,
By	conceiving	of	our	bodies	[in	a	mundane	way],	we	have	dishonoured	the
illusory	body.
Thus	 our	 commitments	 have	 degenerated	 and	 we	 have	 grown	 truly
remorseful.
We	seek	your	forgiveness,	O	male	and	female	bodhisattvas!
	
Most	precious	six	sages,	buddha-bodies	of	emanation,	[and	manifestations	of]
supreme	buddha-mind,
Even	though	you	hold	mastery	over	all	the	sentient	beings	throughout	the
three	world-systems,
And	even	though	you	emancipate	their	respective	worlds	into	the	ultimate
expanse,
By	conceiving	of	our	bodies	[in	a	mundane	way],	we	have	dishonoured	the
illusory	body.
Thus	 our	 commitments	 have	 degenerated	 and	 we	 have	 grown	 truly
remorseful.
We	seek	your	forgiveness,	O	six	sages,	emanational	buddha-bodies!
	
Most	 precious	 male	 and	 female	 gatekeepers,	 [manifestations	 of]	 supreme
buddha-mind,
Even	though	you	are	our	fathers	and	hold	mastery	over	the	three	world-
systems,
And	even	 though	 you	are	 our	 mothers	and	 assimilate	[all	 things]	 in	 the
ultimate	expanse,
By	conceiving	of	our	bodies	[in	a	mundane	way],	we	have	dishonoured	the
illusory	body.
Thus	 our	 commitments	 have	 degenerated	 and	 we	 have	 grown	 truly

remorseful.
We	seek	your	forgiveness,	O	male	and	female	gatekeepers!
CONFESSION	IN	THE	PRESENCE	OF	THE	WRATHFUL
DEITIES
The	confession	of	faults	in	achieving	meditative	stability	in	reality	is	as	follows:
OṂ	As	we	have	failed	to	liberate	the	egotism	of	the	subject-object	dichotomy,
Within	the	original	maṇḍala	of	natural	sameness,
We	still	have	not	realised	the	non-dual	truth	of	the	abiding	nature.
O	non-dual	Buddha-body	of	Reality,	we	seek	forgiveness!

The	confession	of	faults	in	achieving	the	meditative	stability	which	illuminates
all	that	appears	is	as	follows:
	
You	open	the	portals	which	unimpededly	illuminate	the	ultimate	truth,
And	[naturally]	arise	as	the	Buddha-body	[of	Perfect	Resource],	within	an
expanse	of	radiantly	clear	moonlight,
But	 we	 have	 let	 the	 light	 [emanating	 from]	 the	 seminal	 points	 of	 your
‘generative	essence’	be	diffused.
O	Buddha-body	[of	Perfect	Resource],	which	illuminates	all	that	appears,	we
seek	forgiveness!

The	confession	[of	faults	in	achieving]	the	meditative	stability	of	the	causal	basis
[entailing	the	visualisation	of]	the	tiered	celestial	palace	and	the	seats	[of

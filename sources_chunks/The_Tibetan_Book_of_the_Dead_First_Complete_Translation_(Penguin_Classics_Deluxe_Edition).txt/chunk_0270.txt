is	cultivated	in	the	
generation	stage
	of	meditation.	However,
the	Tibetan	equivalent	
dag-pa’i	snang-ba
	is	also	used	colloquially	to	mean	a
‘positive	perspective’	or	‘positive	outlook’	on	life.
	
Purification
	
sbyong-ba
,	Skt.	
śodhana
The	verb	‘to	purify’	has	two	distinct	meanings	in	a	Buddhist	context.	Firstly,
purification	 can	 refer	 simply	 to	 the	 purification	 of	
non-virtuous
	 habits	 or
dissonant	mental	states
,	etc.,	in	which	the	objects	of	purification	are,	without
qualification,	totally	eradicated	from	one’s	mental	continuum.	In	the	second

meaning,	which	arises	more	in	the	context	of	
tantra
,	the	term	‘purification’	has
rather	different	implications.	Here,	the	significance	of	the	word	is	understood	in
terms	of	transmutation	from	an	impure,	polluted	state	into	an	unstained,	purified
state.	This	process	
is	exemplified	by	the	practices	related	to	
Carrying	the	Three
Buddha-bodies	on	to	the	Path
	(
sKu-gsum	lam-’khyer
).	In	this	context,	the	phases
of	 ordinary	 death,	
intermediate	 state
,	 and	 rebirth	 when	 experienced
choicelessly	as	a	result	of	one’s	
past	actions
,	are	the	bases	of	purification.	The
meditations	 on	 the	
Three	 Buddha-bodies
	
are	 the	 purifying	 paths	 and	 the
accomplishments	of	the	
Buddha-body	of	Reality
,	the	
Buddha-body	of	Perfect
Resource
,	and	the	
Buddha-body	of	Emanation
	
are	the	purified	results.
	
Purification	 of	 the	 Lower	 Realms
	
ngan-song	 sbyong-ba
,	 Skt.
durgatipariśodhana
This	 is	 the	
Tantra	 of	 the	 Purification	 of	 the	 Lower	 Realms
(
Sarvadurgatipariśodhanatantra
	
),	which	is	recited	to	assist	the	deceased	in
avoiding	the	pitfalls	of	rebirth	as	a	sentient	being	trapped	in	the	three	
lower
existences
.
	
Quiescence
	
zhi-ba
,	Skt.	
śānti
This	is	a	synonym	for	the	quiescent	state	of	
nirvāṇa
,	in	which	all	
dissonant
mental	states
	and	misconceptions	concerning	
actual	reality
	have	ended,	and
rebirth	in	
cyclic	existence
	no	longer	occurs.	As	such,	it	is	the	antithesis	of	the
rebirth	process	(
srid-pa
).	See	also	under	
nirvāṇa

Rainbow	Light	[Body]
	
’ja’-lus
The	 appearance	 of	 rainbow	 light	 at	 the	 time	 of	 death	 is	 indicative	 of	 the
deceased’s	adeptness	in	the	practices	of	the	
Great	Perfection
	(
rdzogs-pa	chen-
po
)	or	in	certain	other	
perfection	stage
	practices.	There	are	many	incidents
recorded	in	Tibetan	biographical	literature	concerning	the	attainment	of	the
rainbow-light	body	at	the	time	of	death.	On	occasions	when	this	attainment	is
residual,	the	physical	body	will	shrink	dramatically	or	vanish	into	light,	leaving
only	the	hair	or	fingernails	of	the	deceased’s	physical	form	behind.	However,
when	there	is	no	residue,	the	entire	physical	form	will	vanish	into	light.	In	these
latter	cases,	the	body	of	rainbow	light	(
’ja’-lus
)	or	body	of	light	(
’od-kyi	sku
)	is
equivalent	to	the	attainment	of	the	
Buddha-body
	of	Great	Transformation	(Skt.
mahāsaṃkrāntikāya
,	Tib.	
’pho-ba	chen-po’i	sku
).	See

In	the	channel	branch	at	the	southern	gate	of	the	skull,	within	one’s	brain,
Is	sow-headed	[Pāśā],	yellow	in	colour,	holding	a	noose	and	a	skull.
In	the	channel	branch	at	the	western	gate	of	the	skull,	within	one’s	brain,
Is	lion-headed	[Sphoṭā],	red	in	colour,	holding	an	iron	chain	and	a	skull.
In	the	channel	branch	of	the	northern	gate	of	the	skull,	within	one’s	brain,

To	 you,	 the	 Four	 Female	 Gatekeepers,	 who	 are	 pristine	 cognition	 in
emanational	form,
I	bow	down,	make	offerings,	take	refuge,	and	pray:
As	soon	as	we	die	and	begin	to	transmigrate,
At	that	very	moment,	when	the	visions	of	the	intermediate	state	of	reality
dawn,
And	we	roam	[alone]	in	cyclic	existence	[driven]	by	deep-seated	confused
perceptions,

May	Aṅkuśā	and	Pāśā	draw	us	forward,
Obstructing	the	entrances	to	confusion	through	the	four	types	of	birth,
And	opening	the	doors	to	the	four	rites	of	pure	enlightened	activity.
May	Sphoṭā	and	Ghaṇṭā	support	us	from	behind,
And	thus	[encircled]	may	we	be	rescued
From	the	fearsome	passageway	of	the	intermediate	state,
And	be	escorted	to	the	level	of	an	utterly	perfected	buddha.

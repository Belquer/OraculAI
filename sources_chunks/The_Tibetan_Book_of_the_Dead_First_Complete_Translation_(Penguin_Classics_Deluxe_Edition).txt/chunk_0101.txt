lso,	it	is	certainly	possible	that	one	will	recollect	one’s
teacher,	 or	 [if	 one	 has	 trained	 in	 this	 practice]	 that	 one	 will	 focus	 one’s
awareness	at	the	crown	of	one’s	head	[instinctively].	This	is	the	most	profound
crucial	point.
Likewise,	were	one	to	be	engulfed	by	a	great	fire,	or	swiftly	carried	away	by	a
mighty	river,	or	struck	on	the	head	by	lightning,	or	pierced	by	an	arrow	through
the	 heart,	 one	 must	 immediately	 recollect	 one’s	 spiritual	 teacher,	 [as	 being
seated]	on	the	crown	of	the	head,	or	alternatively	one	must	[at	least]	direct	one’s
awareness	 to	 the	 crown	 of	 the	 head.	 This	 is	 called	 the	 ‘instantaneous
consciousness	transference’,	and	it	is	also	known	as	the	‘forceful	consciousness
transference’.	As	this	is	most	profound,	one	should	train	one’s	mind	assiduously
[in	this	technique].
Moreover,	it	is	said	that	at	times	when	ordinary	people	experience	strong
fears,	there	are	many	advantages	when	they	simply	cry	out	‘O	father!	spiritual
teacher!’	or	invoke	the	name	of	a	buddha,	saying,	‘O	Orgyan!’
28
	If	this	is	so,	the
benefits	 of	 [additionally]	 directing	 one’s	 mental	 focus	 towards	 the	 spiritual
teacher,	present	on	the	crown	of	the	head,	are	inconceivable.
There	are,	altogether,	nine	different	pathways	through	which	consciousness
transference	 can	 occur,	 and	 these	 are	 associated	 with	 persons	 of	 superior,
average,	 and	 inferior	 capacity.	 The	 aperture	 of	 the	 crown	 fontanelle	 is	 the
pathway	through	which	[consciousness]	departs	to	the	pure	[realm	of	the]	sky-

farers.	Given	this,	[it	is	said	that]	one	will	attain	liberation	if	awareness	exits
through	the	[crown	fontanelle].	Since	this	is	the	supreme	pathway,	it	is	extremely
important	that	one	trains	in	directing	one’s	mental	focus	towards	this	[aperture].
Furthermore,	if	consciousness	is	transferred	through	the	pathway	of	the	eyes,	[it
is	said	that]	one	will	be	born	as	a	universal	monarch,	and	if	it	is	transferred
through	the	left	nostril,	one	will	obtain	an	unimpaired	human	body.	These	are	the
three	optimum	apertures	[associated	with	those	of	superior	capacity].
One	will,	however,	be	born	as	a	
yakṣa
	if	[consciousness	is	transferred]	through
the	right	nostril,	or	as	a	god	of	the	world-system	of	form	if	[it	is	transferred]
through	the	ears,	and	as	a	god	of	the	world-system	of	desire	if	[it	is	transferred]
through	the	navel.	These	are	the	three	medial	apertures	[associated	with	those	of
average	capacity].	Lastly,	one	will	be	born	as	an	animal	if	[it	is	transferred]
through	the	urethra,	as	a	anguished	spirit	if	[it	is	transferred]	through	the	sexual
passage,
29
	and	as	a	hell	being	if	it	is	transferred	through	the	rectum.	These	are
the	three	inferior	apertures	[associated	with	those	of	inferior	capacity].	Given
that	there	are	such	very	great	consequential	differences	between	the	various
apertures	through	which	consciousness	transference	may	occur,	there	will	be
inestimable	benefits	in	directing	one’s	awareness	to	the	crown	of	the	head,	at	the
time	of	death.
Such	is	the	forceful	consciousness	transference.	SAMAYA!
Consciousness	Transference	of	Ordinary	Beings
In	the	case	of	those	who	have	not	realised	the	meaning	of	emptiness,	and	who	do
not	 know	 the	 significance	 of	 the	 generation	 and	 perfection	 stages	 [of
meditation],	it	is	the	consciousness	transference	of	ordinary	beings	which	should
be	applied	as	follows:	The	head	[of	the	dying	person]	should	point	north,	with
the	body	lying	down	on	the	right	side.	A	spiritual	teacher	or	fellow	practitioner
should	then	remind	[the	dying	person]	to	pay	attention,	and	if	health	permits,	he
or	she	should	be	encouraged	to	take	refuge,	to	
cultivate	an	altruistic	intention,
and	to	confess	negativity.	Then,	the	teacher	should	confer	the	vows	of	the
Buddhist	laity,	and	if	there	is	time,	the	empowerments	of	the	way	of	secret
mantras	should	be	conferred.	Consequently,	by	dying	with	a	positive	momentum
of	 past	 actions,	 the	 individual	 who	 has	 [just	 received]	 these	 u

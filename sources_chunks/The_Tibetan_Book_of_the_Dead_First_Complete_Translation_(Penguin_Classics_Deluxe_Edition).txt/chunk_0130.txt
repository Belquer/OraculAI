deities	and	their	consorts.	Do	not	be	afraid!
Recognise	 all	 that	 arises	 as	 the	 natural	 expressive	 power	 of	 awareness,
manifesting	naturally.
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	the	four	Female	Gatekeepers	will	also	emerge

instantaneously	arise.

from	within	your	brain	and	appear	before	you.	They	will	have	diverse	[animal]
heads	and	bear	diverse	weapons.	But,	do	not	be	afraid!	Recognise	all	that	arises
as	the	natural	expressive	power	of	awareness,	manifesting	naturally.	Now,	at	this
most	critical	point,	remember	your	spiritual	teacher’s	oral	instructions.

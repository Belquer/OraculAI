Means	for	Attainment
	
sgrub-thabs
,	Skt.	
sādhana
The	literature	of	the	Buddhist	
tantras
	is	classified	into	
tantra
	texts	and	means
for	 attainment	 manuals.	 The	 former	 are	 general	 expositions	 concerning	 the
continua	of	the	ground,	path	and	ressult
	associated	with	a	particular	
maṇḍala
of	deities,	while	the	latter	are	specific	manuals	derived	from	and	inspired	by	the
former	as	the	detailed	means	for	attainment,	or	meditative	realisation,	of	a
specific	
maṇḍala
	of	deities.	Such	practices	have	four	phases,	which	are	often
known	 as	 the	
four	 aspects	 of	 ritual	 service	 and	 means	 for	 attainment
(
bsnyen-sgrub	yan-lag	bzhi
).
	
Meditation
	
sgom
,	Skt.	
bhāvanā
Meditation	is	defined	as	a	disciplined	mental	process	through	which	a	person
cultivates	familiarity	with	a	chosen	object,	be	it	an	external	object	like	an	image,
or	even	a	trivial	object	such	as	a	pebble,	etc.,	or	an	internal	object	such	as	one’s
own	mind	or	personal	identity.	According	to	the	
sūtras
,	there	are	two	main	types
of	meditation,	one	emphasising	the	faculty	of	stability	and	single-pointedness	of
mind	and	the	other	emphasising	analysis	and	discrimination.	The	first	type	of
meditation	 is	 absorptive,	 and	 produces	 a	 quality	 of	 mental	 placement	 and
tranquillity,	 known	 as	
calm	 abiding
,	 and	 the	 latter,	 known	 as	
penetrative
insight
,	generates	a	deeper	insight	into	the	profound	natures	of	the	chosen
object.	 In	 the	 context	 of	 the	
tantras
,	 meditation	 additionally	 includes	 the
techniques	of	the	
generation
	and	
perfection	stages
,	as	well	as	those	of	the
Great	Perfection
.
	
Meditational	Deity
	
yi-dam
,	Skt.	
iṣṭadevatā
Forms	or	resonances	of	fully	manifest	
buddhahood
	whose	characteristics	are
defined	or	revealed	by	the	specific	tantric	practices	on	the	basis	of	which	they
are	 visualised.	 After	 receiving	
empowerment
	 and	 guidance	 concerning	 an
appropriate	 meditational	 deity	 or	
maṇḍala
	 of	 deities	 from	 an	 authoritative
spiritual	teacher
,	the	practitioner	
of	the	
tantras
	seeks	to	experientially	cultivate
union	with	the	qualities	of	
buddha-body
	
,	
speech
	and	
mind
	through	the	practice
of	the	
generation	stage
	of	meditation	related	to	a	specific	meditational	deity	or
maṇḍala
	of	deities.	It	is	essential	that	the	meditational	deities	should	not	be
perceived	as	externally	existing	or	independent	beings	but	rather	as	forms	or
resonances	of	
buddha-mind
	itself.	Union	with	the	meditational	deity	is	said	to
confer	supreme	
accomplishment
	on	the	meditator,	in	contrast	to	meditation	on
the	spiritual	teacher,	which	confers	
blessings
,	and	meditation	on	the	
ḍākin
ῑ
,

which	confers	enlightened	or	
buddha	activities
.
	
Meditative	Commitment
	
thugs-dam
This	refers	to	a	resolute	period	of	
meditative	equipoise
,	and	the	
commitments
pertaining	to	meditative	equipoise.	Note	that	the	same	term	is	also	used	as	the
honorific	equivalent	of	
yi-dam
	(meditational	deity).
	
Meditative	Concentration
	
bsam-gtan
,	Skt.	
dhyāna
Meditative	concentration	is	defined	as	the	one-pointed	abiding	in	an	undistracted
state	of	mind	free	from	the	taint	of	
dissonant	mental	states
	(
kleśa
).	It	is	an
advanced	 form	 of	
calm	 abiding
,	 where	 often	 both	
calm	 abiding
	 and
penetrative	 insight
	 may	 be	 present	 in	 perfect	 union.	 In	 the	
sūtras
	 and
abhidharma
	 literature	 of	 the	
Lesser	 Vehicle
,	 four	 states	 of	 meditative
concentration	are	identified	as	be

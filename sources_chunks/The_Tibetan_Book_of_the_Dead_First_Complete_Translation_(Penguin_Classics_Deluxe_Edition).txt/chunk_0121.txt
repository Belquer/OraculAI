hese
radiances]	 to	 be	 natural	 manifestations	 [of	 actual	 reality].	 Achieving
confidence,	in	this	way,	in	the	unchanging	path	of	pure	reality,	and	sustaining	a
continuous	meditative	stability,
53
	
you	will	dissolve	into	the	buddha-body	of
great	spontaneously	present	awareness
54
	
and	irreversibly	attain	buddhahood	in
the	Buddha-body	of	Perfect	Resource.
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	together	with	the	radiances	of	pristine	cognition,
the	six	[dull]	lights	[indicative]	of	the	six	classes	[of	beings]	who	are	obscured
by	impure	and	bewildering	perception,	will	also	arise	simultaneously.	That	is	to
say,	the	dull	white	light	of	the	gods,	the	dull	red	light	of	the	antigods,	the	dull
blue	light	of	the	humans,	the	dull	green	light	of	the	animals,	the	dull	yellow	light
of	the	anguished	spirits,	and	the	dull	smoky	light	of	the	inhabitants	of	the	hells
will	arise	alongside	the	radiances	of	
pure	pristine	cognition.	At	that	moment,	do
not	seize	upon,	or	become	attached	to,	any	[of	these	lights]!	Relax	and	abide	in
a	non-referential	state.	For	if	you	are	fearful	of	the	pure	radiances	of	pristine
cognition	and	become	attached	to	the	impure	lights	of	cyclic	existence	with	its
six	classes	[of	beings],	you	will	assume	a	body	amongst	[one	of]	these	six
realms,	and	you	will	be	debilitated;	for	there	will	be	no	[immediate]	opportunity
for	escape	from	cyclic	existence,	this	vast	ocean	of	suffering.
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	if	you	are	one	who	has	not	been	introduced	to	the
oral	instructions	of	a	spiritual	teacher,	you	will	be	frightened	and	overwhelmed
by	 these	 buddha-bodies	 and	 the	 radiances	 of	 pure	 pristine	 cognition,	 just
described,	and	you	will	feel	attachment	towards	the	[dull]	lights	of	impure	cyclic
existence.	Do	not	do	this!	Be	devoted	to	the	bright	and	dazzling	radiances	of
pure	pristine	cognition.	Be	full	of	devotion	and	think:	‘The	light	rays	of	pristine
cognition,	which	are	the	compassion	of	Those	Gone	to	Bliss,	the	transcendent
lords	of	the	five	enlightened	families,	have	come	to	seize	me	with	compassion.	I
take	refuge	in	them.’	Do	not	be	attached	to	the	bewildering	lights	of	the	six
classes	[of	beings].	Do	not	cling	to	them!	Focus	one-pointedly	on	the	male	and
female	 buddhas	 of	 the	 five	 enlightened	 families	 and	 recite	 the	 following
aspirational	prayer:
	
O,	as	I	roam	in	cyclic	existence	[driven]	by	the	five	virulent	poisons,
May	the	transcendent	conquerors,	[the	male	buddhas]	of	the	five	enlightened

families,	draw	me	forward,
Leading	me	on	the	path	of	radiant	light,
Which	is	the	four	pristine	cognitions	combined.
May	the	five	supreme	female	buddhas,	[the	purity	of]	the	expanse,	support	me
from	behind,
And,	thus	[encircled],	may	I	be	rescued
From	the	light	paths	of	the	six	impure	classes	[of	beings]!
Released	from	the	fearsome	passageway	of	the	intermediate	state,
May	I	be	escorted	to	the	five	utterly	supreme	and	pure	buddha	fields.
	
By	making	this	aspirational	prayer,	[the	superior	adept]	will	recognise	[the
radiances	of	pristine	cognition]	to	be	natural	manifestations	[of	actual	reality]
and	thereby,	upon	dissolving	indivisibly	
with	them,	buddhahood	will	be	attained.
Those	of	average	ability	will	achieve	recognition	on	the	basis	of	fervent	devotion
and	thereby	attain	liberation,	and	even	all	[those	of	inferior	ability]	can,	through
the	power	of	pure	aspiration,	close	the	womb	entrances	through	which	the	six
classes	[of	beings	are	born].	Thus,	if	the	nature	of	‘the	four	pristine	cognitions
combined’	is	realised,	[all	of	the	above	individuals]	can	attain	buddhahood
through	‘the	hollow	passageway	of	Vajrasattva’.	As	a	result	of	being	introduced
in	such	a	clear	and	detailed	way,	the	majority	will	attain	recognition	and	many
[individuals]	will	achieve	liberation.
However,	those	most	lowly	individuals	in	the	human	world	who	totally	lack
the	 propensities	 for	 spiritual	 practice,	 and	 those	 who	 have	 broken	 their
commitments	and	so	forth,	will	continue	to	be	bewildered,	as	a	result	of	their
[negative]	past

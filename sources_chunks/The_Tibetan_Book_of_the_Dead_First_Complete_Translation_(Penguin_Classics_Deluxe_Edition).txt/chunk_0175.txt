f	Aṅkuśā.
Thus	the	entrance	to	miraculous	birth	will	be	obstructed,
And	immeasurable	compassion	will	grow	within	the	mental	continuum.
	
OṂ	VAJRAPĀŚĀ	HŪṂ	is	the	enlightened	intention	of	Pāśā.

Thus	the	entrance	to	womb	birth	will	be	obstructed,
And	immeasurable	loving	kindness	will	grow	within	the	mental	continuum.
	
OṂ	VAJRASPHOṬĀ	VAṂ	is	the	enlightened	intention	of	Sphoṭā.
Thus	the	entrance	to	egg	birth	will	be	obstructed,
And	immeasurable	sympathetic	joy	will	grow	within	the	mental	continuum.
	
OṂ	VAJRAGHAṆṬĀ	HOḤ	is	the	enlightened	intention	of	Gaṇṭhā.
Thus	the	entrance	to	birth	through	heat	and	moisture	will	be	obstructed,
And	immeasurable	equanimity	will	grow	within	the	mental	continuum.
	
[Through	these	enlightened	intentions	of	the	Four	Female	Gatekeepers,
The	entrances	to	the	four	types	of	birth	will	be	obstructed,
And	 the	 four	 immeasurable	 aspirations	 will	 grow	 within	 the	 mental
continuum,
While	[externally]	the	four	corresponding	rainbow	lights	[white,	yellow,	red
and	green]	will	appear.]
21
	
Through	this	expansive	diffusion	of	the	enlightened	intention
Of	the	buddha-mind	of	the	Forty-two	Peaceful	Deities,
The	aggregate	of	conceptual	thoughts	is	naturally	liberated,
Causing	bone-relics,	small	relics,	and	rainbow	lights	to	appear.
22
How	wonderful!
Within	the	naturally	arising	diffusive	expanse	of	the	enlightened	intention	of
the	Sixty	Herukas,
Like	the	sun	emerging	from	the	clouds,
This	naturally	arising	enlightened	intention	then	manifests	as	follows,
Within	the	field	of	experience	of	fortunate	beings:
	
OṂ	RULU	RULU	HŪṂ	BHYOḤ	HŪṂ
	
This	mantra	is	the	unified	enlightened	intention	of	the	Sixty	Herukas.
Thus	mental	constructs	associated	with	dissonant	mental	states	are	liberated	in
primordial	purity,	as	an	expanse	of	supreme	pristine	cognition,
While	[externally]	the	indestructible	sound	of	the	eight	syllables	of	the	RULU
mantra	will	resound,

And	 manifold	 white	 fiery	 lights	 will	 shine	 [in	 the	 sky	 following	 the
cremation].
	
How	wonderful!
[Then],	the	enlightened	intentions	of	all	the	Sixty	Herukas	naturally	arise
individually:
	
HŪṂ	HŪṂ	HŪṂ	HŪṂ	HŪṂ	HŪṂ
The	mantra-letters	of	the	naturally	present	causal	basis	arise
In	the	form	of	these	seed-syllables	of	the	Six	Male	Herukas.
Thus	the	six	dissonant	mental	states	will	be	naturally	liberated,
And	arise	inseparably	from	the	Six	Herukas,
While	[externally]	six-coloured	flames	will	appear	[during	the	cremation].
	
HŪṂ	HŪṂ	HŪṂ	HŪṂ	HŪṂ	HŪṂ
	
The	mantra-letters	of	the	naturally	present	causal	basis	arise
In	the	form	of	these	seed-syllables	of	the	Six	Īśvar
ῑ.
Thus	 mental	 constructs	 associated	 with	 the	 six	 objects	 will	 be	 naturally
liberated,
And	arise	inseparably	from	the	Six	Īśvar
ῑ
,
While	 [externally]	 six-coloured	 rainbow	 lights	 will	 appear	 [during	 the
cremation].
OṂ	MAHĀ	KRODHA	MAHĀŚRĪHERUKA	HŪṂ	PHAṬ	is	the	enlightened
intention	of	Mahottara	Heruka.
Thus	the	dissonant	mental	state	of	ignorance	will	be	liberated	in	primordial
purity,
While	[externally]	dark	brown	flames	will	spiral	to	the	right	[during	the
cremation],
Unequivocally	 indicating	 an	 irreversible	 liberation,	 inseparable	 from
Mahottara.
	
OṂ	 BUDDHA	 KRODHA	 MAHĀŚRĪHERUKA	 HŪṂ	 PHAṬ	 is	 the
enlightened	intention	of	Buddha	Heruka.
Thus	the	dissonant	mental	state	of	delusion	will	be	liberated	in	primordial
purity,

While	 [externally]	 brilliant	 white	 flames	 will	 shoot	 upwards	 [during	 the
cremation],
Unequivocally	indicating	liberation	inseparable	from	Buddha	Heruka,
[As	the	deceased	will	be	born	in	the	central	Buddha	field	of	the	Dense	Array].
	
OṂ	VAJRA	KRODHA	MAHĀŚRĪHERUKA	HŪṂ	PHAṬ	is	the	enlightened
intention	of	Vajra	Heruka.
Thus	the	dissonant	mental	state	of	hatred	will	be	liberated	in	primordial	purity,
While	[externally]	dark	blue	flames	will	shoot	towards	the	east	[during	the
cremation],
Unequivocally	indicating	[liberation]	inseparable	from	Vajra	Heruka,
As	[the	deceased]	will	be	born	in	the	[eastern]	Buddha	field	of	Manifest	Joy.

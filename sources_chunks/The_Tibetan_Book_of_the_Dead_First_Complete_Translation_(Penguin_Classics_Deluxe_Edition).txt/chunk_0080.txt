part	of	the	head	is	missing,
One	may	die	after	seven	months.
If	the	head	is	missing	above	the	neck,
One	may	die	after	five	months.
If	the	head	and	the	neck	are	both	missing,
One	may	die	after	three	months.
If	the	upper	trunk	is	missing,

One	may	die	after	two	months.
If	the	lower	trunk	is	missing,
One	may	die	after	one	month.
	
Next,	when	[assessing]	the	completeness	[of	the	image]
In	relation	to	the	number	of	days	[one	is	yet	to	live]:
If	the	right	side	of	the	body	is	missing,
One	may	die	in	twenty-nine	days.
If	the	left	side	[of	the	body]	is	missing,
One	may	die	in	twenty-one	days.
	
Second,	the	[overall]	shape	[of	the	image]	should	be	examined	as	follows:
If	[the	image]	is	square,	one	may	die	after	five	months.
If	it	is	round,	one	may	die	after	four	months.
If	it	is	semicircular,	one	may	die	after	three	months,
And	if	it	is	oblong,	one	may	die	after	two	months.
In	all	these	cases,	death	may	be	averted	by	ritual	deception.
However,	if	it	is	triangular,	one	will	die	after	one	month.
If	it	resembles	a	bundled	corpse,	one	will	die	after	half	a	month.
If	it	is	upside	down,
23
	one	will	die	after	ten	days.
In	these	last	three	cases,	death	cannot	be	averted	and	is	absolutely	inevitable.
Third,	the	colour	[of	the	image]	should	be	examined	as	follows:
If	it	is	white	in	colour,	and	fades	from	the	centre,
This	is	a	sign	that	one	has	displeased	serpentine	water	spirits,	king	spirits,	and
gods.
If	it	is	black	in	colour,	and	fades	from	the	right,
This	 is	 a	 sign	 that	 one	 has	 been	 overwhelmed	 by	 beguiling	 forces	 and
imprecatory	female	spirits.
If	it	is	red	in	colour,	and	fades	from	the	left,
This	is	a	sign	that	one	has	been	seized	by	martial	haunting	spirits,	and	by
one’s	own	lifelong	companion	gods,
Or	else	that	one	will	encounter	woundings	and	diseases.
If	it	is	yellow	in	colour,	and	fades	from	the	head,
This	is	a	sign	that	one	has	been	seized	by	serpentine	water	spirits,	king	spirits
and	bewitchers.
If	it	is	blue	in	colour,	and	fades	from	the	legs,

This	is	a	sign	that	one	has	been	seized	by	serpentine	water	spirits	and	lake-
dwelling	medicinal	spirits.
If	it	is	hazy	and	diffuse,
This	is	a	sign	that	one	has	been	seized	by	imprecatory	female	spirits	and	the
acolytes	of	Yama.
If	it	appears	yellowish	and	uneven,
[This	is	a	sign	that	one	has	been	seized]	by	the	spirit	lords	of	the	soil.
If	it	is	garish,	irregular,	and	variegated,
[This	indicates	that]	one	has	been	seized	by	the	eight	classes	of	spirits,
Comprising	the	diverse	beguiling	forces	of	death.
All	 these	 are	 [the	 signs]	 recognised	 with	 respect	 to	 the	 colours	 [of	 the
reflected	image].
	
When	any	of	the	above	signs	of	death	occur,
One	should	persevere	with	[the	practices	set	down	in]	the	
Ritual	Deception	of
Death
,
And	then	re-examine	[the	image],	in	the	manner	described	above.
If	the	limbs	are	complete,
[Death]	may	be	ritually	deceived.
But	if	the	ritual	deception	of	death	fails	to	be	effective,	even	after	being
applied	three	times,
This	is	a	sign	that	the	time	has	come	for	one’s	life	to	end.
Therefore,	those	of	highest	[potential]	should	maintain	the	view,
Which	accords	with	the	profound	abiding	nature	[of	reality],
24
Those	 of	 average	 [potential]	 should	 meditate	 on	 the	 meditational	 deity,
according	to	the	generation	and	perfection	stages,
And	those	of	lowest	[potential]	should	persevere	with	the	accumulation	[of
merit].
	
The	above	is	the	analysis	of	the	reflected	image	in	the	sky.
SIGNS	OF	NEAR	DEATH
The	analysis	of	the	signs	of	near	death	is	now	presented.
The	examination	of	[the	signs]	described	so	far	should	be	made	when	one	is	in

good	health,
For	[at	that	time]	there	are	[still]	many	possibilities	[for	recovery],	because	the
signs	of	a	remote	death	can	be	ritually	deceived.
Here,	however,	with	regard	to	a	sick	person,
The	signs	indicative	of	[near]	death	arise	as	follows:
	
If	one’s	gums	grow	grimy	and	black,
This	is	called	the	‘gathering	of	the	personal	demons	of	the	elements’,
And	it	indicates	that	one	may	die	after	nine	days.
If	the	nostri

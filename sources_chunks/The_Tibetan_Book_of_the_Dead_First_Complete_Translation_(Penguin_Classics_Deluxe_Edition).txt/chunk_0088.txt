E	syllables.	[Then],
on	each	of	these	inscribed	wheels,	one	should	visualise	the	deities	who	embody
the	nature	of	these	elements,	corresponding	in	colour	to	their	respective	wheels.
8
Then	 one	 should	 make	 five	 offerings,	 [one]	 to	 [each	 of]	 these	 [deities],
confess	all	negativity,	and	pray	for	one’s	desired	purpose.	After	this,	recite	the
seed-syllables	 of	 the	 individual	 [deities]	 the	 appropriate	 number	 of	 times,
corresponding	to	the	age	of	the	person	in	years,	and	[visualise	that]	the	[seed-
syllables]	are	then	absorbed	into	the	[respective]	deities.
9
	Then	[each	of	the
depictions]	of	the	[elemental]	wheels	should	be	placed	inside	containers	made
from	two	small	bowls	of	dough,	which	are	sealed	together,	and	bound	with
threads	of	five	colours,	forming	[the	pattern	of]	a	cross.
In	addition,	a	dough	effigy	of	the	subject’s	human	form	should	be	prepared,
one	cubit	in	height.	The	dough	should	be	mixed	with	wood,	water,	fire,	earth,
and	the	breath	of	different	species	of	sentient	beings.
10
	[Depictions	of]	the
[same]	five	seed-syllables	should	then	be	inserted	into	the	five	[corresponding]
sense-organs	[of	this	effigy].
11
As	for	the	substances	to	be	used	for	the	ritual	deception	of	the	malevolent
forces	[which	cause	death],	create	substitutes,	which	may	be	made	either	of	red
minium	clay,	or	else	from	dough,	which	is	then	painted.	These	should	all	be
equal	finger-widths	in	size,	black,	red,	yellow,	white,	green	and	multicoloured,
12
corresponding	in	number	to	the	age	of	the	subject.	These	should	be	mixed	with
the	subject’s	grime,	clothing,	nasal	mucus,	saliva,	tears,	hair,	fingernails,	and	so
forth;	as	well	as	with	ground	jewels	or	precious	substances.	They	should	then	be
adorned	with	[five]	coloured	wool	threads	and	various	silks,	and	also	decorated
with	many	sorts	of	bird	feathers,	[which	are	indicative]	of	bad	omens.
13
	Each
[substitute]	should	then	have	a	torma-offering	[prepared],	corresponding	to	it	in
colour,	and	[it	should	be	surrounded	by]	a	number	of	dough	
chang-bu
	offerings,

equalling	the	subject’s	age	in	years.
Then,	consecrate	all	these	with	the	six	mantras	and	six	gestures,	and	repeat	the
following	words,	‘Take	them!	Take	them!	O	mighty	[malignant]	ones!	Your
craving!	Your	attachment!	Your	clinging!	Your	memories!	Your	grasping!	Your
thoughts!	Your	contact!	Let	go	of	them!	Be	pacified!	And	be	free!’
Then,	together	with	the	[bowls	containing	the	elemental]	wheels,	cast	[these
substitutes]	into	the	torrent	of	a	wide	river.	Death	will	thereby	be	averted	for	up
to	three	years.	It	is	best,	therefore,	if	this	rite	is	performed	once	every	three
years,	even	before	the	indications	[of	death]	have	occurred.
SPECIFIC	RITES	FOR	AVERTING	DEATH
I	bow	down	to	the	deity	Mahākāruṇika,
Who	is	a	sanctuary	of	great	bliss.
	
The	methods	employed	in	the	specific	rites	for	averting	death	are	now	presented.
[Ritual	Averting	of	Signs	of	Near	Death]
For	all	these	rites,	which	follow,	it	is	best	if	the	subject’s	own	spiritual	teacher
can	be	present,	or	alternatively	a	sympathetic	friend.	They	should	empower	the
five	sense-organs	[of	the	subject]	with	the	seed-syllables	of	the	elements.
14
Then,	in	cases	when	the	fingernails	become	lustreless,	[as	described	in	the
previous	chapter],	a	religious	feast	should	be	offered	to	seven	monks.	Donations
should	be	offered,	and	one	should	receive	the	[Buddhist]	vows,	wearing	yellow
clothes.	If	one	has	already	taken	these	vows,	one	should	retake	them.	Thereby,
[death]	will	be	averted.
Similarly,	in	cases	when	the	cornea	of	the	eyes	begins	to	fade,	small	terracotta
imprints	of	white	earth	should	be	moulded,	their	number	equalling	the	subject’s
own	age	in	years.	After	seven	circumambulations	[of	the	terracotta	imprints],
cast	these	into	a	lake	or	river,	and	then	[retreat],	taking	a	number	of	paces	equal
to	the	subject’s	age	in	years,	while	reciting	the	Heart-mantra	of	Dependent
Origination
15
	and	not	looking	back.
In	cases	when	the	hair	of	the	nape	of	the	neck	grows	upwards,	one	shoul

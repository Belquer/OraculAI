I	bow	down	to	the	primordial	lords,	Samantabhadra	and	Samantabhadr
ῑ
,
And	to	the	Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities!
	

This	[text]	is	the	
Liberation	by	Wearing:	Natural	Liberation	of	the	Psycho-
physical	Aggregates
,
In	which	[the	mantras]	of	the	Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities,	Those	Gone	to
Bliss,	are	encompassed.
	
How	wonderful!	This	is	a	great	naturally	arising	[mantra	circle].
The	yogin	who	embraces	this	is	immensely	fortunate.
The	yogin	who	encounters	this	is	immensely	fortunate.
The	yogin	who	upholds	this	is	immensely	fortunate.
The	yogin	who	reads	this	is	immensely	fortunate.
As	it	confers	liberation	by	reading,	there	is	no	need	for	meditation.
As	it	confers	liberation	by	wearing,	there	is	no	need	for	spiritual	practice.
As	it	confers	liberation	through	contact,	there	is	no	need	for	training.
As	it	confers	liberation	through	feeling,	there	is	no	need	for	reflection.
This	[mantra	circle]	confers	natural	liberation	whenever	it	is	encountered.
This	is	the	natural	liberation	of	the	psycho-physical	aggregates.
This	is	a	field	of	experience	of	the	fortunate!

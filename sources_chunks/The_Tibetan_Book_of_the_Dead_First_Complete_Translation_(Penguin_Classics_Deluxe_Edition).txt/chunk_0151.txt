to	the	brāhman	class,	or	as	the
child	 of	 an	 accomplished	 master,	 or	 into	 a	 family	 which	 maintains	 an

immaculate	lineage	of	the	[sacred]	teachings,	or	into	a	family	where	the	mother
and	father	are	deeply	devout.	Then,	once	I	have	taken	on	a	body	which	is	blessed
with	the	merit	of	being	able	to	act	on	behalf	of	all	sentient	beings,	I	shall
[dedicate	 myself	 to]	 acting	 on	 their	 behalf!’	 You	 must	 concentrate	 your
motivation	on	this	thought	and	[thus]	enter	the	womb.
As	you	enter	the	womb,	consecrate	it	[by	perceiving	it]	as	a	celestial	palace	of
the	deities.
37
	
Be	full	of	devotion.	Ensure	that	you	enter	whilst	praying	to	and
imagining	that	you	are	receiving	empowerments	from	the	conquerors	of	the	ten
directions	and	from	their	sons,	as	well	as	from	the	meditational	deities	and,	in
particular,	from	Mahākāruṇika.
[However	be	warned],	for	as	you	make	this	choice	of	a	womb	entrance,	there
is	a	risk	of	error.	There	is	the	risk	of	error	when,	through	the	potency	of	past
actions,	an	excellent	womb	entrance	is	perceived	as	a	bad	one,	and	when	a	bad
womb	entrance	is	perceived	as	a	good	one.	At	this	time,	the	essential	points	of
the	teaching	are	crucial.	Therefore,	once	again,	you	should	act	as	follows.	Even
though	perceptions	of	an	excellent	[womb	entrance]	may	occur,	do	not	become
attached	to	these.	And	[conversely]	even	though	perceptions	of	a	poor	[womb
entrance]	may	occur,	do	not	feel	aversion.	The	essential	point	of	the	profound
and	 genuine	 [instructions]	 is	 that	 you	 enter	 the	 womb	 in	 a	 state	 of	 great
equanimity,	utterly	free	from	[the	dichotomies	of]	good	and	bad,	acceptance	and
rejection,	or	attachment	and	aversion.
	
Nevertheless,	with	the	exception	of	certain	persons	who	have	experience	of	this
[equanimity]	it	is	difficult	[for	beings]	to	sever	themselves	from	the	deep-seated
and	 long-lasting	 disease	 of	 negative	 habitual	 tendencies.	 Therefore,	 if	 [the
deceased]	remains	unable	to	be	free	from	attachment	and	aversion,	in	the	above
manner,	such	negative	beings	who	are	of	the	lowest	capacity	may	seek	refuge	in
the	animal	realms	or	similar	[kinds	of	inferior	existences].	In	order	to	counteract
this,	again	calling	to	the	deceased	by	name,	you	should	speak	as	follows:
	
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature,	if	you	do	not	know	how	to	choose	a	womb	entrance
and	 you	 are	 unable	 to	 give	 up	 your	 attachment	 and	 your	 aversion,	 then,
regardless	of	which	of	the	above	appearances	arise,	you	must	call	out,	by	name,
to	the	Three	Precious	Jewels.	Take	refuge	in	them!	Pray	to	Mahākāruṇika!	Go
forward	with	your	head	held	high.	Recognise	that	this	is	the	intermediate	state!
Give	up	your	attachment	and	your	clinging	to	the	friends,	sons,	daughters	and

relatives	that	you	have	left	behind.	These	[attachments]	are	not	helpful	[to	you
now].	Enter	into	the	blue	light	of	the	human	realm.	Enter	into	the	white	light	of
the	realm	of	the	gods.	Enter	into	the	mansions	of	precious	jewels	and	the
gardens	of	delight.
	
This	[introduction]	should	be	enunciated	up	to	seven	times.	Then	one	should
pray	to	the	buddhas	and	bodhisattvas,	[reciting	the	
Aspirational	Prayer	Calling
to	the	Buddhas	and	Bodhisattvas	for	Assistance
].
38
	Then	one	should	read	aloud,
up	to	seven	times,	the	
Aspirational	Prayer	which	Protects	from	Fear	of	the
Intermediate	States
,	the	
Root	Verses	of	the	[Six]	Intermediate	States
,	and	the
Aspirational	 Prayer	 which	 Rescues	 from	 the	 Dangerous	 Pathways	 of	 the
Intermediate	States
.
39
	Then,	one	should	also	read	aloud,	clearly	and	with	correct
pronunciation,	the	
Liberation	by	Wearing:	Natural	Liberation	of	the	Psycho-
physical	Aggregates
.	And	you	should	also	read	aloud	the	
Spiritual	Practice:
Natural	Liberation	of	Habitual	Tendencies
.

CONCLUSION
Thus,	 [in	 summary],	 by	 acting	 correctly,	 yogins	 with	 high	 realisation	 will
[successfully]	effect	the	transference	of	consciousness	at	the	moment	of	death,
and,	being	spared	the	necessity	of	having	to	wander	through	the	intermediate
states,	w

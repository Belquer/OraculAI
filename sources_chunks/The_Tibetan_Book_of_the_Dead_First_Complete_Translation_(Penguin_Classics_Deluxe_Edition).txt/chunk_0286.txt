e	future	time	by	a	prophesied	
treasure-finder
	(
gter-ston
).
Accordingly,	it	is	believed	that	the	students	of	
Padmasambhava
	
have	continued
to	emanate	in	the	form	of	
treasure-finders
	in	successive	centuries	in	order	to
reveal	 these	 treasure-teachings.	 Other	 kinds	 of	 treasure-teachings	 revealed
directly	from	the	
enlightened	intention
	of	
buddha-mind
	in	a	telepathic	manner
(
dgongs-gter
),	 or	 in	 a	 pure	 visionary	 experience	 (
dag-snang
),	 are	 also
recognised.	There	are	many	such	lineages	extant	today,	including	that	of	the
present	text,	and	they	are	maintained	mostly,	but	by	no	means	exclusively,	by	the
Nyingma
	school.
	
Treatise
	
bstan-bcos
,	Skt.	
śāstra
The	 term	 treatise	 (
śāstra
)	 in	 the	 Buddhist	 context	 generally	 refers	 to
authoritative	works	written	by	
accomplished	masters
	elucidating	the	profound
meaning	of	the	
Buddha
’s	scriptures	(
pravacana
).	Treatises	are	contrasted	with
scriptures	(both	
sūtras
	and	
tantras
),	the	latter	being	attributed	to	the	
Buddha
.

Trisong	Detsen
	
khri-srong	lde’u	btsan
The	thirty-eighth	king	of	Tibet	and	son	of	King	
Tride	Tsukten
.	Despite	his
accession	to	the	throne	at	a	tender	age	and	the	opposition	of	ministers	who	were
Bon
	
sympathisers	he	established	Buddhism	as	the	state	religion	of	Tibet.	He

invited	 both	
Śāntarakṣita
	 and	
Padmasambhava
	 to	 construct	 Tibet’s	 first
monastery	at	
Samye
	
and	to	transmit	the	diverse	Indian	lineages	of	the	
vinaya
,
sūtras
	and	
tantras
.	He	became	a	realised	practitioner	of	the	
tantras
	in	his	own
right,	 under	 the	 guidance	 of	
Padmasambhava
,	 and	 actively	 sponsored	 the
education	and	projects	of	his	highly	organised	translation	teams.	According	to
traditional	 accounts,	 it	 was	 King	
Trisong	 Detsen
	 who	 requested
Padmasambhava
	 to	 give	 the	 teachings	 that	 are	 presented	 in	 our	 text.	 See
Gyurme	Dorje’s	‘Brief	Literary	History’.
	
Tulku
	
sprul-sku
,	Skt.	
nirmāṇakāya
	
In	its	philosophical	and	classical	usage	the
term	refers	to	the	
Buddha-body	of	Emanation
.	However,	based	on	this	concept
of	emanation,	a	different	usage	developed	in	Tibet	following	the	inception	of	a
tradition	to	formally	recognise	the	incarnations	of	high	spiritual	teachers	after
their	death.	The	first	such	
tulku
	to	be	given	formal	recognition	was	
Karma
Pakshi
,	the	second,	
Karmapa
	(1204-83).	Later,	other	important	
tulku
	institutions
emerged,	such	as	that	of	the	
Dalai	Lama
	
and	
Panchen	Lama
,	and	the	system	of
recognising	 successive	 generations	 of	
tulkus
	
became	 commonly	 established
throughout	Tibet	and	the	Himalayan	region.
	
Turning	of	the	Wheel	of	the	[Sacred]	Teachings
	
chos-kyi	’khor-lo	bskor-ba
,
Skt.	
dharmacakrapravartana
This	metaphor	refers	to	the	promulgation	of	the	Buddhist	teachings	by	the
Buddha
	and	continues	to	be	used	metaphorically	with	regard	to	the	teaching
activity	of	successive	
lineage	holders
.	The	
Buddha	Śākyamuni
	is	recognised	to
have	promulgated	three	sequential	‘turnings	of	the	wheel’.	The	association	with
the	concept	of	a	wheel	derives	from	a	comparison	with	the	‘wheel	of	sharp
weapons’	said	to	be	held	in	the	hand	of	a	
universal	monarch
.	Within	the	context
of	this	comparison	the	
sacred	teachings
	are	composed	of	ethical	discipline	(the
central	 axis),	 analytic	
discriminative	 awareness
	 (the	 sharp	 spokes)	 and
meditative	concentration
	(the	stabilising	perimeter).	See	also	
Sūtra
.
	
Tuṣita
	
dga’-ldan
Tuṣita
	is	the	name	of	the	fourth	of	the	six	
god
	realms,	which	are	said	to	be
located	within	the	
world-system
	of	desire	(Skt.	
kāmadhātu
).	It	is	regarded	as	the
current	abode	of	the	future	
buddha
	
Maitreya

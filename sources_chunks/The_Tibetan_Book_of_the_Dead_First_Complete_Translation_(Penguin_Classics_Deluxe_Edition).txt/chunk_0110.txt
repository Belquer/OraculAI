beration.	Recognition
of	the	‘first	inner	radiance’	[of	the	ground]	takes	place	in	this	way.
	
[Introduction	to	the	Inner	Radiance	of	the	Path]
	
If,	however,	it	is	feared	that	[the	deceased]	has	not	recognised	the	first	inner
radiance,	the	so-called	‘second	inner	radiance’	[of	the	path]	will	arise.	[Again,	it
is	said	that	this	second	inner	radiance]	lasts	a	little	more	than	the	time	it	takes	to
eat	a	meal,	after	the	respiration	has	ceased.	Specifically,	it	arises	once	the	vital
energy	has	escaped	into	the	right	or	left	channel,	whichever	is	appropriate

depending	on	the	positive	and	negative	past	actions	[of	the	deceased],	and	once
the	vital	energy	has	emerged	through	one	of	the	orifices	of	the	body.
29
	When
this	occurs,	the	consciousness	suddenly	becomes	awake	and	lucid.
Although	it	is	said	that	this	second	inner	radiance	also	lasts	[approximately]
for	as	long	as	it	takes	to	eat	a	meal,	this	actually	depends,	as	before,	on	whether
or	not	the	energy	channels	are	healthy	and	whether	or	not	[the	individual]	has	or
lacks	meditative	experience.
Now,	at	this	point,	the	consciousness	emerges	from	the	body	and,	[initially],
the	individual	may	not	know	whether	or	not	he	or	she	has	died.	The	relatives	are
seen	as	before,	and	their	cries	of	sorrow	can	be	heard.	During	this	period,	before
the	harsh	and	bewildering	experiences	related	to	past	actions	have	arisen,	and
before	 the	 terrifying	 experiences	 related	 to	 Yama	 have	 occurred,	 the	 oral
teaching	should	be	given.
30
	This	[oral	teaching]	concerns	both	the	perfection
stage	and	the	generation	stage	[of	meditation].	If	[the	deceased]	was	engaged	in
[the	practices	of]	the	perfection	stage,	one	should	call	to	him	or	her	three	times,
by	name,	and	repeat	the	above	[instruction,	which	is]	the	introduction	to	inner
radiance.	If	[the	deceased]	was	engaged	in	[the	practices	of]	the	generation	stage,
one	 should	 read	 aloud	 the	 formal	 description	 of	 the	 individual’s	 chosen
meditational	deity	as	set	down	in	the	corresponding	meditative	cycle.	Then
remind	him	or	her	with	the	following	words:
	
O,	Child	of	Buddha	Nature!	Meditate	on	this,	your	meditational	deity.	Do	not	be
distracted!	Concentrate	intently	on	your	meditational	deity!	Meditate	that	[the
deity]	appears,	and	yet	is	without	inherent	existence,	like	[the	reflection	of]	the
moon	in	water.	Do	not	meditate	on	the	deity	as	a	solid	corporeal	form!
31
	
If	 [the	 deceased]	 was	 an	 ordinary	 person,	 without	 a	 specific	 practice,	 then
preface	the	introduction	with	the	following	words:
	
Meditate	on	the	Lord	of	Great	Compassion!
32
	
By	means	of	such	an	introduction,	there	is	no	doubt	that	even	those	who	have
not	recognised	[the	nature	of]	the	intermediate	state	will	do	so.
This,	[the	above]	precise	reminder,	should	be	given	by	a	spiritual	teacher	or
sibling	to	those	who,	despite	having	already	received	this	introduction	from	a

spiritual	 teacher	 while	 they	 were	 alive,	 have	 an	 undeveloped	 meditative
experience,	 and	 accordingly	 will	 not	 recognise	 the	 intermediate	 state	 by
themselves.	Equally,	this	instruction	is	of	crucial	importance	in	the	case	of	those
who,	despite	their	meditative	experience,	are	bewildered	by	serious	illness	at	the
moment	of	death	and	therefore	cannot	recall	[their	past	meditative	experiences];
and	finally,	it	is	particularly	necessary	in	the	case	of	those	beings	who,	despite
their	former	meditative	experience,	are	at	risk	of	falling	into	lower	existences	as
a	result	of	having	broken	their	vows	and	having	failed	to	maintain	their	basic
commitments.
33
[As	stated	above],	it	is	best	if	[recognition]	occurs	during	the	first	intermediate
state.	However,	if	it	does	not	occur	therein,	awareness	can	be	awakened	and
liberation	attained	during	the	second	intermediate	state.	This	second	intermediate
state	 is	 also	 called	 ‘the	 pure	 illusory	 body’.	 [During	 this	 second	 phase],
consciousness	achieves	an	instance	of	clarity,	even	though	the	deceased	may	not
know	 whether	 or	 not	 they	 are

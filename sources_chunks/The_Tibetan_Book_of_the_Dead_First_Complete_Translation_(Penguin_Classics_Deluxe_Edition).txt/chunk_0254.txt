Lotus
	
padma
In	Buddhist	poetry	and	the	visual	arts	the	lotus,	particularly	the	variety	which
grows	in	water,	is	often	used	as	a	symbol	of	purity.	The	lotus	grows	from	an
unclean	mire,	yet	it	is	clean	and	unpolluted	by	the	mire	surrounding	it.	One	finds

the	 lotus	 depicted	 as	 the	 cushion	 or	 seat	 of	 many	
meditational	 deities
	 in
Buddhist	
tantric
	iconography.	Among	the	
five	enlightened	families

Padma
or	Lotus	family	(

buddha

Love/Loing	Kindness
	
byams-pa
,	Skt.	
maitr
ῑ
In	 a	 Buddhist	 context,	 loving	 kindness	 is	 defined	 as	 a	
mentalfactor
characterised	by	a	sincere	wish	that	others	enjoy	happiness.	According	to	this
definition,	love	is	one	of	the	eleven	‘wholesome	
mental	factors
’	categorised	in
the	
abhidharma
	literature.	However,	in	the	case	of	the	
four	immeasurable
aspirations
,	the	word	love	is	used	as	an	abbreviation	for	‘great	love’	(
byams-pa
chen-po
,	Skt.	
mahāmaitr
ῑ
)	which	refers	to	an	altruistic	mental	attitude	that	is
unbiased	in	its	love	towards	all	beings	and	is	also	spontaneous	and	natural.	It	is
said	that	such	a	spontaneous	sense	of	universal	or	unqualified	love	can	only	arise
as	 a	 result	 of	 a	 systematic	 meditative	 training	 and	 an	 understanding	 of
emptiness

Madhyamaka
	
dbu-ma
Derived	from	the	Sanskrit	expression	
madhyamapratipad
,	meaning	the	‘Middle
Way’	between	the	extremes	of	
eternalism
	and	
nihilism
,	which	was	expounded
by	
Sākyamuni	Buddha
	in	the	earliest	
sūtras
,	
Madhyamaka
	(
dbu-ma
)	is	the
name	of	one	of	the	most	influential	among	the	four	classical	schools	of	Indian
Buddhist	philosophy.	Within	the	context	of	the	
Madhyamaka
	school,	the	Middle
Way	refers	to	the	doctrine	of	
emptiness
	(
śūnyatā
),	which	is	held	to	be	the
ultimate	nature	of	all	
things.	According	to	this	view,	all	phenomena,	whether
mental	 or	 physical,	 cannot	 be	 found	 to	 possess	 any	 independent	 or	 self-
validating	natures,	and	their	existence	and	identity	are	regarded	as	valid	only

within	a	relative	framework	of	worldly	convention.	Further,	it	is	propounded	that
not	only	do	phenomena	exist	solely	in	dependence	upon	causes	and	conditions,
but	even	their	identities	depend	on	conceptions	and	labelling.	Nevertheless,	this
school	 holds	 that,	 unlike	 mere	 fantasies,	 such	 as	 unicorns	 for	 example,
phenomena	do	exist	conventionally	and	their	ontology	must	be	accepted	as	valid.
Such	a	metaphysical	position	is	designated	the	‘Middle	Way’	in	that	it	is	the	mid-
point	between	the	extremes	of	total	non-existence	of	
r

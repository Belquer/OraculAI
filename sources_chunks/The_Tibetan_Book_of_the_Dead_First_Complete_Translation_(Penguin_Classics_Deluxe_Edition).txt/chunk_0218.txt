	literature,	a

)	is	divided	into	eighty	lesser	or	intervening	aeons.	In	the
course	of	one	great	aeon,	the	external	universe	and	its	sentient	life-forms	unfold
and	disappear.	During	the	first	twenty	of	the	lesser	aeons,	the	universe	is	in	the
process	of	creation	and	expansion	(

);	during	the	next	twenty	it
remains	created;	during	the	third	twenty,	it	is	in	the	process	of	destruction	or
contraction	(
samvartakalpa
);	and	during	the	last	quarter	of	the	cycle,	it	remains
in	a	state	of	destruction.

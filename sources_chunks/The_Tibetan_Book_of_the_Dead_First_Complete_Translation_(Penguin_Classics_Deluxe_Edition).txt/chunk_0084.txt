the	 thirty-three	 patterns	 of	 conceptual	 thought	 that	 originate	 from
aversion	will	cease.
	
[During	this	process,	each	exhalation	of]	breath	will	become	increasingly
protracted,
While	all	the	blood	of	the	body	will	converge	in	the	‘life	channel’,
40
And	then	a	single	drop	of	blood	will	form	at	the	heart-centre.

In	this	way,	the	phenomenon	called	‘blackness’	will	occur,
Engulfing	the	suffocating	mind	in	blackness,
And	one	will	experience	the	sensation	of	falling	into	darkness,	as	if	into	an
abyss.
At	 that	 point,	 ‘attainment’	 will	 dissolve	 into	 the	 ‘[subtle	 mind	 of]	 near
attainment’,
And	the	seven	patterns	of	conceptual	thought	that	originate	from	delusion	will
cease.
	
[During	this	process],	the	mouth	will	open,	and	the	eyes	will	roll	upwards,
[Exposing]	their	pale	underside.
External	appearances	[will	fade],	as	during	the	setting	of	the	sun,
And	[finally]	the	sense	faculties,	memory,	and	perceptions	will	all	cease,
Whereupon,	all	[external]	appearances	will	be	absorbed	into	blackness.
At	that	point,	the	[exhaled]	breath	will	extend	[from	the	body]	by	a	cubit,
And	[all]	internal	appearances	will	[also]	come	to	resemble	darkness.
	
Then,	the	blood	in	the	heart	will	form	two	drops,
The	head	will	stoop,
And	the	[exhaled]	breath	will	extend	[from	the	body]	by	an	arrow-length.
	
Following	this,	the	blood	in	the	centre	of	the	heart	will	form	three	drops,
And,	with	HIKA-like	gasps,	the	[exhaled]	breath	will	extend	[from	the	body]
by	a	double	arm-span.
41
[Then],	the	external	breath	will	cease,	and,	engulfed	by	blackness,	one	will
become	unconscious.
Then,	the	white	and	red	‘generative	essences’	will	meet	together	at	the	heart,
And,	as	this	occurs,	one	will	swoon	into	a	state	of	blissfulness.
Thus,	consciousness	dissolves	into	inner	radiance,
42
Engendering	the	experience	of	the	‘coemergent	delight’.
[At	this	point],	awareness	dissolves	into	actual	reality,	at	the	centre	of	the
heart,	[like	the	meeting	of]	mother	and	child.
43
[It	is	at	this	time	that]	the	inner	breath	will	[also]	cease,
44
And	the	vital	energy	and	mind	will	rest	in	the	central	channel.
	

[At	this	moment],	the	inner	radiance	of	the	ground	dawns	upon	all	sentient
beings,
And,	in	the	case	of	a	few	yogins	who	have	achieved	realisation,
At	this	moment,	the	inner	radiance	of	the	path	meets	[the	inner	radiance	of	the
ground],
45
Like	a	[meeting	of]	a	mother	and	child,
And	 [thus,	 now],	 instantaneously,	 in	 an	 ascending	 and	 core-penetrating
manner,
These	[yogins]	will	actualise	the	uncreated	Buddha-body	of	Reality,
And	through	the	Buddha-bodies	of	Perfect	Resource	and	Emanation,
They	will	perform	inestimable	actions	for	the	sake	of	all	beings.
[Thus],	the	three	buddha-bodies	will	be	spontaneously	present,
And	buddhahood	will	have	been	attained.
	
Because	of	this,	one	should	understand	the	significance	of	obtaining	a	human
body,
And	cherish	the	experiential	cultivation	of	the	profound	[sacred]	teachings.
For,	even	though	the	genuine	inner	radiance	[of	the	ground]	will	[always]
arise	[at	the	moment	of	death],
In	the	case	of	all	beings	who	have	not	[already]	realised	the	[inner	radiance	of
the	path],
It	will	not	be	recognised.
The	[past]	births	that	one	has	assumed	and	left	behind	are	countless	and
infinite,
And,	although	the	inner	radiance	has	indeed	arisen	an	indescribable	[number
of	times],
It	has	been	obscured	[again	and	again]	by	the	dense	[fog	of]	coemergent
ignorance,
And	[thereby],	one	has	come	to	wander	endlessly	through	cyclic	existence.
This	is	why	it	is	important	to	achieve	such	a	secure	level	[of	realisation	in	this
life].
[SIGNS	INDICATING	THE	PLACE	OF	SUBSEQUENT
REBIRTH]

At	the	moment,	[as	described	above],	when	the	outer	breath	is	about	to	cease,
Signs	will	also	occur	[which	indicate]	the	place	of	subsequent	rebirth.
If	[when	dying]	the	right	hand	quivers,	one	talks	nonsensically,
And	bodily	warmth	recedes	from	under	the	right	armpit,
[This	indicates	that]	one	will	be	born	as	an	antigod.
If	nasal	mucous	and	vital	wind	flow	through	the	l

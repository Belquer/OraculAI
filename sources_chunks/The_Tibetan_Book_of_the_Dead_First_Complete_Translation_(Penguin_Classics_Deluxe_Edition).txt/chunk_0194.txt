ῑ
	from	the	east	who	enact	the
white	rites	of	pacification	(
shar-nas	zhi-ba’i	las-mdzad	rnal-’byor	dbang-phyug
drug
)	are	sometimes	depicted	holding	a	vajra	in	addition	to	their	individual
hand-emblems,	indicating	that	they	belong	to	the	retinue	of	Vajra	Heruka	in	the
east.	Among	them,	Manurākṣas
ῑ
	in	Ch.	5	is	simply	described	as	‘white’	(
dkar-
mo
)	and	in	Ch.	11	as	‘dark	brown’	(
smug-nag
).	Also,	in	Ch.	11,	Brahmāṇ
ῑ
	is
erroneously	described	as	‘red-yellow’	(
dmar-se
),	Kaumār
ῑ
	as	solely	red	(
dmar-
mo
),	and	Vaiṣṇāv
ῑ
	as	solely	‘blue’	(
sngon-mo

Vajrā	is	also	known	as	Piṅgalā.	See	Ch.	11,	p.	265.

The	six	yogin
ῑ
	from	the	south	who	enact	the	yellow	rites	of	enrichment	(
lho-
nas	rgyas-pa’i	las-mdzad	rnal-’byor	dbang-phyug	drug
)	are	sometimes	depicted
holding	a	jewel	in	addition	to	their	individual	hand-emblems,	indicating	that	they
belong	to	the	retinue	of	Ratna	Heruka	in	the	south.

The	six	yogin
ῑ
	from	the	west	who	enact	the	red	rites	of	subjugation	(
nub-nas
dbang-gi	las-mdzad	rnal-’byor	dbang-phyug	drug
)	are	sometimes	depicted
holding	a	lotus	in	addition	to	their	individual	hand-emblems,	indicating	that	they

belong	to	the	retinue	of	Padma	Heruka	in	the	west.	Among	them,	in	Ch.	11,
Ekacāriṇ
ῑ
	is	erroneously	described	as	‘yellow’	(
ser-mo
),	Rudhiramad
ῑ
	as	solely
‘red’	(
dmar-mo

ῑ
	as	solely	‘green’	(

The	six	yogin
ῑ
	from	the	north	who	enact	the	rites	of	wrath	(
byang-nas	drag-
po’i	las-mdzad	rnal-’byor	dbang-phyug	drug
)	are	sometimes	depicted	holding	a
crossed-vajra	in	addition	to	their	individual	hand-emblems,	indicating	that	they
belong	to	the	retinue	of	Karma	Heruka	in	the	north.	Among	them,	in	Ch.	11,
Agnāy
ῑ
	and	Cāmuṇḍ
ῑ
	are	described	as	solely	‘red’	(
dmar-mo

ῑ
	as	solely
‘black’	(
nag-mo

ῑ
	and	Vāyudev
ῑ
	as	solely	‘blue’	(
sngon-mo

in	Ch.	11	(Varanasi	reprint)	Vāyudev
ῑ
	is	depicted	as	‘snake-headed’	instead	of
‘wolf-headed’.

This	verse	concerns	the	four	yogin
ῑ
	who	enact	their	emanational	rites	at	the
outermost	gates	of	the	skull	(
sprul-pa’i	las-mdzad	dbang-phyug	sgo-ma	bzhi
),
and	who	complete	the	group	of	twenty-eight	Iśvar
ῑ.
	Note	that	while	in	our	text
all	four	of	these	gatekeepers	are	generally	referred	to	by	the	collective	name
Vajrā	(
rdo-rje-ma
),	their	distinctive	names	are	found	in	Ch.	14,	pp.	370	-	71,	and
in	Longchen	Rabjampa,	GGFTC,	pp.	1127-28.
28
	
These	are	the	fifty-eight	wrathful	deities,	with	the	addition	of	Mahottara
Heruka	and	Krodh
ῑ
śvar
ῑ.
29
	
The	three	smeared	sacraments	(
byug-pa’i	rdzas	gsum
)	of	the	charnel	ground,
‘ashes,	blood	and	grease’	(
thal-chen	rakta	zhag-gi	zo-ris
),	indicate	that	they	have
subdued	envy.	The	‘skirts	of	moist	hide	and	flayed	tiger-skin’	(
ko-rlon	gYang-
gzhi	stag-gi	sham-thabs
)	indicate	that	delusion,	attachment	and	aversion	are
respectively	subdued	by	the	ten	powers	(
daśabala
),	desireless	compassion	and
wrathful	compassion.	The	snakes	indicate	their	subjugation	of	the	five	social
classes.	For	a	description	of	the	symbolism	of	the	wrathful	deities	in	general,	see
T.	Norbu,	
The	Small	Golden	Key

	(

sgo-ma	bzhi
)	described	in	the	previous
verses,	the	wrathful	maṇḍala	also	includes	the	eight	great	projectresses	(
spor-
byed	chen-mo
),	who	propel	the	consciousness	of	the	deceased	to	higher	rebirths,

and	who	are	enumerated	individually	in	Ch.	6,	pp.	108-9.

[When	it	is	worn	at	the	time	of	death]

To	discover	the	abodes	of	the	Conquerors	and	their	children,

[When	it	is	worn	at	the	time	of	death]
It	will	liberate	all	beings	who	wear	it	and	are	touched	by	its	breath,
11
While	[externally]	rainbows	and	subtle	relics	will	multiply.
	
How	wonderful!
Since	 the	 unified	 enlightened	 intention	 of	 non-dual	 Samantabhadra	 and
Samantabhadr
ῑ
12
	is	naturally	present,
Each	[of	these	individual	mantras]	has	the	capacity	to	confer	liberation.
Thus	they	are	[known	as]	the	twenty-five	seminal	points,	or	mantra	lines,
In	which	reality	naturally	resonates	and	naturally	arises.
SAMAYA

[PART	TWO]
How	wonderful!
Then	 the	 male	 and	 female	 consorts	 [Samantabhadra	 and	 Samantabhadr
ῑ
],
having	entered	into	non-dual	union,
Emit	multiple	male	and	female	emanations,
From	which	arises	the	maṇḍala	of	the	hundred	enlightened	families	of	the
Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities.
13
	
Within	the	naturally	arising	diffusive	expanse	of	the	enlightened	intention	of
the	Forty-two	Peaceful	Deities,
Like	the	sun	emerging	from	the	clouds,
This	naturally	arising	enlightened	intention	then	manifests	as	follows,
Within	the	field	of	experience	of	fortunate	beings:
	
OṂ	ĀḤ	HŪṂ	BODHICITTA	MAHĀSUKHA	JÑĀNADHĀTU	ĀḤ	is	the
unified	enlightened	intention	of	the	Forty-two	Peaceful	Deities.
Thus
14
	the	mass	of	conceptual	thoughts	will	be	liberated	in	primordial	purity,
As	an	expanse	of	supreme	pristine	cognition,
While	[externally]	the	indestructible	sound	of	these	sixteen	syllables
And	inestimable	rainbow	lights	and	relics	will	appear.
	
How	wonderful!
Then	the	individual	enlightened	intentions	of	the	Forty-two	Peaceful	Deities
naturally	arise:
OṂ	HŪṂ	SVĀ	ĀṂ	HĀ
	
The	mantra-letters	of	the	naturally	present	causal	basis
15
	arise
In	the	form	of	these	seed-syllables	of	the	five	male	buddhas	of	the	enlightened
families.
Thus,	the	five	psycho-physical	aggregates

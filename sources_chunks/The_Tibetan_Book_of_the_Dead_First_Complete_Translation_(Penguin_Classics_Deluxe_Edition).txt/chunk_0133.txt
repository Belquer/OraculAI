ational	deity	by	name	and	pray	with	the
following	words:	‘I	am	roaming	in	the	intermediate	state	-	come	quickly	to
rescue	me!	Hold	me	in	your	compassion,	O	precious	meditational	deity!’	Call	to
your	spiritual	teacher,	by	name,	and	pray	with	the	following	words:	‘I	am
roaming	in	the	intermediate	state.	Rescue	me!	Do	not	let	your	compassion
forsake	me!’	Pray	devotedly,	yet	again,	to	the	assembled	blood-drinking	deities
and	recite	this	aspirational	prayer:

	
O,	as	I	roam	in	cyclic	existence,	[driven]	by	deep-seated	habitual	tendencies,
May	the	assembly	of	[male]	Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities,	transcendent
lords,	draw	me	forward,
Leading	me	on	the	path	of	[radiant]	light,
Through	which	[all]	awesome	and	terrifying	perceptions	are	left	behind.
May	the	assembly	of	the	wrathful	female	deities,	Dhātv
ῑ
śvar
ῑ
	[and	so	forth],
support	me	from	behind,
And,	thus	[encircled],	may	I	be	rescued
From	the	fearsome	passageway	of	the	intermediate	state,
And	be	escorted	to	the	level	of	an	utterly	perfect	buddha.
	
Now,	when	I	roam	alone,	separated	from	my	loved	ones,
And	[myriad]	images	of	emptiness	arise,	naturally	manifesting,
May	the	buddhas	[quickly]	release	the	power	of	their	compassion,
And	 may	 the	 fear	 of	 the	 awesome	 and	 terrifying	 intermediate	 state	 be
annulled.
	
When	the	five	radiant	lights	of	pristine	cognition	dawn,
May	I	recognise	them	as	my	own	[nature],	without	awe	and	without	terror,
And	as	the	[manifold]	forms	of	the	Peaceful	and	Wrathful	Deities	arise,
May	 I	 be	 fearlessly	 confident	 and	 recognise	 [the	 characteristics	 of]	 the
intermediate	state.
	
When	I	experience	suffering	as	the	result	of	negative	past	actions,
May	the	meditational	deities	dispel	all	such	misery,
And	as	the	natural	sound	of	reality	reverberates	like	a	thousand	peals	of
thunder,
May	all	[sounds]	be	heard	as	the	resonance	of	the	Six	Syllables.
	
When	I	am	driven	on	by	past	actions,	unable	to	find	a	refuge,
May	the	Great	Compassionate	One,	Mahākāruṇika,	protect	me.
And	as	I	experience	the	suffering	of	habitual	tendencies	and	past	actions,
May	the	meditative	stabilities	of	inner	radiance	and	bliss	[naturally]	arise.
	
May	the	fields	of	the	five	elements	not	rise	up	as	a	hostile	force,

And	may	I	see	[them	as]	the	fields	of	the	five	enlightened	families!
	
Recite	this	aspirational	prayer	with	deep	devotion.	It	is	very	important.	As	all
fear	and	terror	dissolve,	you	will	assuredly	attain	buddhahood	in	the	Buddha-
body	of	Perfect	Resource	-	so	do	not	be	distracted!
	
The	above	introduction	should	be	given	three	or	up	to	seven	times.	Even	if	the
negativity	of	the	deceased	is	very	great	and	even	if	the	inheritance	of	past	actions
is	very	bad,	it	is	impossible	for	liberation	not	to	occur	-	[if	there	is	recognition].
Yet,	regardless	of	how	often	these	teachings	are	given,	if	recognition	does	not
occur,	[the	deceased]	will	necessarily	roam	into	the	intermediate	state	of	rebirth.
The	introduction	to	that	[state]	is	presented	below,	in	detail.
CONCLUSION	OF	THE	INTRODUCTION	TO	THE	INTERMEDIATE
STATE	OF	THE	TIME	OF	DEATH	AND	THE	INTERMEDIATE	STATE
OF	REALITY
Since	it	is	generally	the	case	that	one	will	experience	bewilderment	at	the	time	of
death,	this	
Liberation	by	Hearing
	is	indispensable,	whatever	one’s	degree	of
familiarity	 with	 [meditative]	 practices.	 In	
the	 case	 of	 those	 who	 have
considerable	 familiarity	 with	 [meditative]	 experience	 the	 recognition	 of	 the
nature	of	reality	can	arise	instantly,	as	soon	as	awareness	separates	from	the
material	body.	Therefore,	it	is	essential	to	cultivate	this	experience	[of	reality]
during	 one’s	 lifetime.	 Those	 who	 have	 been	 introduced	 to	 [the	 nature	 of]
awareness,	 directly,	 and	 who	 have	 cultivated	 [this	 aspect	 of	 meditative
experience]	 during	 their	 lifetime,	 will	 have	 the	 greatest	 ability	 during	 the
intermediate	 state	 of	 the	 time	 of	 death	 when	 the	 inner	 radiance	 arises.
Additionally,	those	who	during	their	lifetime	emphasised	meditation	on	the	deity,
acc

Generally	this	refers	to	Sanskrit	syllables
or	letters	visualised	as	the	quintessential	basis	from	which	arise	the	forms	of
meditational	deities
	in	the	practices	of	the	
Vehicle	of	Indestructible	Reality
.
Often	these	letters	or	syllables	are	the	first	letter	of	the	name	of	the	deities
themselves,	or	syllables	or	letters	that	are	associated	with	specific	
enlightened
families
.	So,	for	example,	in	the	case	of	many	of	the	deities	belonging	to	the
Vajra
	
family
	of	
Aks
obhya
,	they	are	visualised	as	arising	from	the	letter	HŪṂ,
while	for	deities	belonging	to	the	
Padma
	
family
,	the	letter	ĀḤ	is	often	utilised,
and	so	on.

This	term	refers	to	the

Hinduism	and	Jainism	project	onto	phenomena.	Elsewhere,	the	Sanskrit	term
ātman
	
(Tib.	
bdag
),	referring	to	the	notion	of	an	independent	or	substantial	self,
has	also	sometimes	been	translated	as	‘self-identity’.
	
Selflessness
	
bdag-med
,	Skt.	
nairātmya
Selflessness	in	Buddhist	philosophy	is	understood	to	imply	the	lack	of	
inherent
existence
	both	in	the	personality	and	in	physical	and	mental	phenomena.	The
Lesser	Vehicle
	schools	such	as	
Vaibhāṣika
	and	
Sautrāntika
	expound	the	doctrine
of	 selflessness	 only	 in	 terms	 of	 personal	 identity.	 They	 propound	 that
selflessness	refers	to	the	absence	of	an	independently	existing	‘self’	or	‘I’,
emphasising	 that	 the	 self	 is	 neither	 substantial	 nor	 self-sufficient.	 Nowhere

among	the	aggregates	of	the	person,	either	individually,	collectively,	or	even	in
their	continuity	can	one	find	a	substantial	or	solid	being.	Material	objects	are
nothing	but	a	series	of	indivisible	atomic	particles,	and	consciousness	is	nothing
but	 a	 series	 of	 indivisible	 time	 moments.	 However,	 the	
Cittamātra
	 and
Madhyamaka
	schools	extend	this	notion	of	selflessness	to	embrace	all	physical
and	 mental	 phenomena.	 All	 such	 phenomena	 are	 equated	 with	
emptiness
(
śūnyatā
),	and	these	
Greater	Vehicle
	philosophical	schools	therefore	speak	of
both	the	selflessness	of	persons	(
pudgalanairātmya
)	 and	 the	 selflessness	 of
phenomena	 (
dharmanairātmya
).	 Nevertheless,	 substantial	 philosophical
differences	exist	between	the	two	
Greater	Vehicle
	schools	in	their	views	on
what	it	is	that	is	being	negated	by	the	doctrine	of	
emptiness
.

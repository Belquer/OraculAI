meditational	deity
	and
an	approximation	of	the	
pristine	cognition
	of	the	
meditational	deity
	during	the
generation	stage
	(Skt.	
utpattikrama
),	the	perfection	stage	employs	techniques
for	controlling	the	
energy	channels
,	
vital	energies
	and	
seminal	points
	within
the	practitioner’s	transmuted	body.	The	purpose	is	to	make	manifest	the	
inner
radiance
	 induced	 by	 the	 ever-deepening	 realisation	 of	 the	 four	 kinds	 of
emptiness
	or	‘dissolution	stages’	and	of	the	
coemergent	pristine	cognition
induced	 by	 the	
four	 delights
.	 The	 factor	 that	 marks	 the	 transition	 from
generation	stage
	to	perfection	stage	is	the

The	practitioners	of	the	
Lesser	Vehicle
	(
h
ῑ
nayāna
)	include	both	pious	attendants
and	
hermit	buddhas
	(Skt.	
pratyekabuddha
).	The	primary	differences	between
them	 are	 the	 focus	 and	 modalities	 of	 their	 practice	 on	 the	 path	 towards
liberation
	from	
cyclic	existence
.	The	pious	attendant	places	greater	emphasis	on
destroying	the	mistaken	belief	in	personal	identity	(
pudgala
)	by	overcoming	the
primary	and	secondary	
dissonant	mental	states
,	while	the	
hermit	 buddha
additionally	comes	to	realise	that	objective	phenomena	are	devoid	of	
inherent
existence
.	Characteristically,	the	pious	attendants	depend	on	oral	instructions
when	both	receiving	teachings	and	when	giving	guidance	to	others	on	the	path.

Posture	of	the	Bodhisattvas
	
sems-dpa’i	skyil-krung
,	Skt.	
sattvaparyaṅka
Also	known	as	the	posture	of	royal	ease	(
mahārājal
ῑ
lāsana
),	this	is	the	posture
in	 which	 seated	 male	 and	 female	
bodhisattvas
	 are	 commonly	 depicted
iconographically	or	visualised	in	meditation	in	which	the	right	leg	is	extended
and	the	left	leg	drawn	in.	The	extended	right	leg	and	foot	symbolises	the
abandonment	of	all	negative	defects,	and	the	drawn	in	left	leg	symbolises	the
deity’s	understanding	and	cultivation	of	all	positive	attributes.	As	the	combined
purity	 of	 the	 deity’s	
compassionate	
skilful	means
	 (extended	 right	 leg)	 and
discriminative	awareness
	
(drawn	in	left	leg),	this	posture	also	represents	the
abandonment	of	the	two	extremes	of	
cyclic	existence
	and	
nirvāṇa
.
	
Posture	of	the	Lion

The	posture	of	the	lion	is	the	posture	assumed	by	
Sākyamuni	Buddha
	at	the
time	of	his	passing,	lying	on	the	right	side	with	his	right	arm	bent	at	the	elbow
and	his	palm	supporting	the	head.

Power

,	Skt.	
bala
In	general,	spiritual	power	is	classified,	along	with	
discriminative	awareness
and	
compassion
,	as	one	of	the	three	principal	attributes	to	be	cultivated	by
bodhisattvas
,	symbolised	in	this	case	by	the	form	of	the	
Bodhisattva	Vajrapāṇi
.

More	specifically,	
bodhisattvas
	cultivate	ten	spiritual	powers	(
daśabala
)	with
respect	 to	 their	 reflections,	 higher	 aspirations,	 practice,	
discriminative
awareness
,	 aspirational	 prayers,	 diverse	
vehicles
,	 modes	 of	 conduct,
emanational	 abilities,	
enlightenment
,	 and	 teaching	 of	 the	 sacred	 doctrine.
Distinct	 from	 these	 are	 the	 so-called	 ten	 powers	 of	 the	
buddhas
(
daśatathāgatabala
),	which	are	all	included	among	the	categories	of	
buddha
attributes
.	
Buddhas
	are	said	to	be	endowed	with	spiritual	power	because	they
have:	(i)	the	power	of	knowing	the	positive	and	negative	contingencies	of	all
things,	(ii)	the	power	of	knowing	the	maturation	of	
past	actions
,	(iii)	the	power
of	 knowing	 diverse	 volitions,	 (iv)	 the	 power	 of	 knowing	 diverse	
sensory
spectra
,	(v)	the	power	of	knowing	those	who	are	of	supreme	ability	and	those
who	are	not
